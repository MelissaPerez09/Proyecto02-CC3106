When I reached high school, my parents didn't let me see her give a talk because it was on a school night. I carried that chip on my shoulder well into adulthood. 

I finally got to see her in my 30's when she spoke at a theater in the city where I lived at that time. I burst into tears when I spoke to her, briefly, at the meet and greet. She was incredibly kind, but you could tell she's used to people reacting this way to her 😅. It was very emotional for me to see my hero in person. I've seen various, lesser hero scientists in person since then. It was a personal mission for a while.

Shortly after takeoff she pulled out her bag and was writing notes to people who had sent her letters. She did this for the entire 4.5 hour flight. At one point I noticed she had a stuffed chimpanzee in her bag and asked her how many air miles the stuffy had. She said something to the effect of how he travels with her everywhere so it was quite a lot. I mentioned that I also travel with one of my kids stuffed animals (a shark) but it wasn't and cute as the chimpanzee.

Their bullshit is over staying its reality. Which is why some of the 70s style stuff in contrast to the contemporary setting fit so well. I think its supposed to feel out of place.

Sean Penn and Leo/Taylor represent kind of cartoons of the political spectrum/stereotypes that dominated US for so long. Burnt out lefties, that blur the line of righteousness and self indulgence. Good intentions but kind of all over the place. Sean Penn being a cartoon of hyper nationalist, patriotism to the point of racism. Destructive for what is ultimately petty ego/insecurity and meaningless corporate gain. At the same time, they are both inexplicably drawn to each other in a tornado of sex and violence.

It has all led to a chaotic, absurdist landscape where they both continue to play out their messy entanglements. Which is where the daughter and other younger characters come in.

Hate to say this, but it’s BY FAR DiCaprio’s most forgettable performance, but of course it’s not because his lack of talent but because the horribly written character. 80% of his time on screen is just filler to make the movie longer with zero chance for him to show his genius. We know nothing about the girl other than she does martial arts and she has a couple queer friends. Benicio Del Toro’s character is not even worth mentioning with the entire migrant house storyline. The only somewhat interesting character is Sean Penn’s, but they managed to mess that up too with him walking away from the scene after getting shot in the face with a sawn-off shotgun.

Personally after watching the film I think having authoritarianism as the backdrop for the story will mean that it isn’t talked about as much as it would have been years ago due to pervasive media illiteracy propagated by the “Netflixtalisation” of content. Most mainstream films now have subtext and themes literally spoken by characters as dialogue because the suits are worried people have their heads in their phones. This film doesn’t. It is well rounded characters navigating a reality to achieve their goals. It reminded me a lot of No Country For Old Men in that yes it’s cops and robbers, but it’s got way much more going on behind it. Back then I remember the ending of that film capturing a lot of imagination in the public about expectations of film endings but I don’t see a similar conversation being there for this film nowadays.

Smash cut into fast flashes of battles across centuries: swords clashing, glimpses of different eras.

A few ominous lines of dialogue to set up the mythology.
Then the music creeps in: a slow, haunting build of “Who Wants to Live Forever” in the background.

Midway through, it swells into Connor MacLeod’s struggles. His losses, his burden, his destiny.

For me, It felt like a lot was missing, story and character-wise but the animation and music was pretty sweet. I don't think it's a bad movie and I also respect that art resonates with people in all sorts of different ways.

My issue with a lot of the praise that this movie receives is that people describe this movie as objectively great media while also defending it's shortcomings with ""it's a kids movie"" or ""the music and art was great so it's okay that the story is a bit weaker"" or my least favourite one, ""there's a directors cut that makes the movie great so it's chill"". There are definitely great parts of this movie but weak points of any form of media shouldn't be defended by qualities that are unrelated to what is being criticized.

Collectively, we've become too forgiving of shortcomings and it feels (I know this is pretty dramatic) dangerous. When we celebrate decent as great, it disincentivizes greatness altogether and the behaviour that I've described drives the bar for media further and further down. We deserve greatness and sometimes we have to settle for less because greatness is a hard thing to achieve, but we shouldn't redefine it just because it's rare.

It's okay to love something that's not great but it's equally as important to be acknowledge that. Greatness is subjective but if you have valid criticisms that would usually move the needle, then that should say enough. But if you genuinely thought the movie was great altogether, all the power to you!

Weinstein is a horrific person, and 99% of the cuts/edits he demanded hurt the final product. But having only seen Kill Bill as two volumes, I at the very least love how Tarantino chose to go about splitting it into two very distinct halves when Weinstein made him split the movie in two. Vol 1 leans heavier on the samurai and “action movie” elements, turning the “style above all” knob to 11 with minimal dialogue, while Vol 2 is more about the martial arts and Western movie influences, relatively more subdued with a lot more dialogue. And that’s to say nothing of the cliffhanger at the end of Vol 1 and “last time on” to start Vol 2.

I hope it’s either just the two parts (plus anime) together with an intermission, or it’s Tarantino having completely redone the sequencing to put everything in a different perspective.

1nw5xbt,nhdw9av,u/shutz2,2025-10-02T16:04:29+00:00,1,"As a single 4-hour movie, the pacing is all wrong.  And it has some filler that works when it's split into two parts, but just gets tedious in a single long movie.

A few years ago, I watched a video by the Angry Video Game Nerd where he proposed an edit of the two movies into a single 2-hour movie, and he had many good ideas, but his editing seemed way too aggressive to me, as I enjoy the way Tarantino lets some of his scenes ""breathe"".  But AVGN's ideas to resequence the movie for better pacing seemed sound to me.  The following is copy-pasted from a comment I made a while back that describes what I did:

I made my own fanedit based on his proposed sequence, but without all the small cuts into scenes. I took out a few things that were kind of superfluous, but the scenes I kept I mostly kept unedited, apart from what I absolutely needed to cut to allow things to flow to the next scene. But the main thing was changing the sequence of events to get a movie with much better pacing and build-up (and this is more or less what the AVGN guy was suggesting with his edit, so he should get the credit)

SPOILER WARNING: if you haven't already seen both movies stop reading NOW!

- Start with the wedding rehearsal scene, Bill showing up, and finally the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad arriving
- Opening credits (merging the vol.1 and vol.2 credits) ending with us seeing the Bride lying on the floor
- the sheriff and his son at the church
- the bride at the hospital in a coma, giving us a chance to flash back to Bill telling the story of Pai Mei
- back to the Bride in a coma getting a visit from Elle
- another flashback to her going to Pai Mei to train. On her last punch on the big wooden beam, she wakes with a start from her coma (rape scene cut for time and pacing)
- Getting out of the hospital, and Tarantino's foot fetish scene in the Pussy Wagon (unfortunately, without the rape scene, we lose the explanation for why she takes the Pussy Wagon...  That's hard to fix, and would require cutting some scenes that I still feel are important)
- From there, straight to Okinawa to get the sword
- Then we get O-Ren's story (including the animated part) This serves to establish O-Ren's importance (more on that later) ending after she kills her ""dissenter""
- Bill visits Bud, and they talk about B getting a Hanzo sword
- Then B visits Copperhead and kills her in front of her daughter
- B then goes to Bud's place, where he buries her alive. The point at which she's buried alive is almost precisely at the mid-point of this edit, which works really well for pacing.
- We then get the scene from the following morning when Elle visits Bud and kills him with a Black Mamba
- We then go back slightly to watch B get out of her coffin, and walk back to Bud's place with the Sun creeping back up into the sky, so that when we cut back to Elle coming out of Bud's trailer, B is there.
- The Elle vs. B fight. When B slams the trailer's door behind her at the end of this scene, cut straight to the club where the Crazy 88 fight happens.
- We see O-Ren with her crew, and how the hosts are scared of her and her gang, and we see B arriving
- The whole Crazy 88 fight (if I'd had access to the color version, I would have used it)
- The fight with O-Ren. Skip the scene outside from the end of Vol.1 with Sofie Fatale because we cut straight to--
- The drive over to Bill's place (also skip the scene where B finds out where Bill is... it's easy to assume she would know already)
- The whole sequence at Bill's plays out normally, as does the ending of the movie.

There's more to my edit than that, but the point is, this sequence is better because: - it keeps the big fight setpiece for near the end, kind of like how video games will often have the penultimate boss fight be more challenging than the actual final boss fight (many of the Metroid games feature a more challenging Ridley fight than the final boss fight of the game!) which is why it was important to build up O-Ren earlier in the movie!

B's nadir happens at almost precisely the mid-point, when she's buried alive.
The ""boss fights"" keep building up in challenge: Copperhead -> Bud (debatable, since there's no real fight) -> Elle -> O-Ren
The pacing doesn't drop to a crawl in the second half with all the flashbacks and exposition happening earlier on (but still interspersed with action so you don't get too tired of all the exposition)
It does ruin the surprise as to who B is early on, but that only made sense when these were two movies separated by a year's wait.

And the long scenes that were cut were the least important, and actually felt like padding so both movies could be about 2h long each. As it stands, my edit lasts about 3h10, ignoring the end credits (I basically appended the vol.1 end credits at the end of the vol.2 end credits, which makes for about 20 minutes of end credits. A more ambitious editor might have completely redone the end titles to remove all the redundancies, but I enjoyed all the varying fonts and presentation of these credit sequences, so I kept them in (as well as the outtake with B gouging the eye out.)

Anyway, apart from a few small details I couldn't fix because I could only work from the two movies I had, I like the result enough that this is the version I've been watching and rewatching for the past few years.",-0.8927,neg,0,0

A thing that always bugs me about it though is how much they harp on his girlfriend from the opening scene. The ending is him still upset about it, refreshing his computer, staring at her picture. She’s a complete fabrication. He got with his current wife around the time he was in Harvard and has stayed with her since. He did get drunk one night after a previous breakup and blogged about an ex but the writer used that as an inciting incident and reoccurring characteristic of Mark’s character. When Eduardo is talking about his crazy ex Mark looks all sad and says “yeah but at least you got a girlfriend”. Like why make him this broken hearted sick puppy. Even at the end the lawyer girl berates by saying that “he’s gonna go around thinking that girls don’t like him for whatever reason but that they really don’t like him because he’s an asshole”.

You can feel both he and Hathaway absolutely crushed as the realization sets in. They don't sell it with some big ridiculous freakout but with that quick stomach drop and 1000 yard stare right as TARS reads out 23 years. And the sting is driven further by Zimmer's score. A long, slow decrescendo immediately answered by a dissonant higher note slowly stabbing in like a knife and following McConaughey out. Been a while since my band days so forgive any incorrect terms.

Anyway, that absolute menace slowly plays with your emotions bringing some major elements back into the score slowly, building back to one of the main theme's leitmotifs as McConaughey sits down trying to steady himself for what he's about to watch. The score keeps building back up across relentlessly long shots of McConaughey rapidly breaking down as all 23 of those years are pumped into his brain. The chord progression is careful to never get TOO hopeful but also never too down. Meant to reflect life's ups and downs but compressed into one single strand.

To be slightly more specific, assuming this is in 3/4, the quarter notes are constantly progressing upwards yet still bouncing back down first before jumping up. The sustained note below them provides a somber baseline that is almost ominous by contrast. And it keeps strumming along as if it's all working towards some agreement.

But nah, not with ol Zims at the podium. Instead he just fuckin yanks the carpet out from under you literally mid-note. Doesn't even wait for a solid beat.

You're holding onto an emotional cliff while his son is possibly saying his last goodbyes and this man comes along and plucks you right off as the score completely cuts out to leaving you sitting awkwardly in silence with McConaughey and his creaky chair desperate to see more...just to have his now adult daughter glow and shift into frame from the darkened screen (with another slow high-pitches stab by the score). Actually absolute cinema.

Some additional S-tier shit again from Nolan specifically here too: The light fading in and out on McConaughey's face drops out once more for a longer period as he waits. But sneaks back in to help that ""Hey dad!"" burn just a smidge more. Also such a small choice with the type of display/video being used and it's hard to describe why it works but trust me if this was just like standard well-lit full color clear footage it wouldn't have had the same impact. That tiny moment right at 4:09 where ""Murph"" pops on screen slightly obscured is goddamn \*chef's kiss\*. Very very slightly delaying the revelation even to the audience just makes that hit even harder.

So yeah, big fan of this movie.

ETA - Regarding the ending (I'ma make this real small **do not read if you haven't seen this movie**, you've already spoiled enough for yourself):

^(People have a whole lot to say about how the film wrapped up. it's possibly the most common criticism. That and Nolan's lust for hamfisted exposition usualy rattled off by characters walking around in two different)

^(locations at two different times carrying on the same sentence, but I digress. I didn't have too much of a problem with it.)

^(I'm not religious. I don't even consider myself particularly spiritual these days. I was raised Catholic and used to still believe in something so maybe part of me still wants to, but that's another subreddit. Even as a cold stoic I appreciated the way the film crosses over the boundary of what we think we understand so far firmly into some truly wild shit.)

^(And that's just it, really. We have no idea beyond that point. Hell, we barely even know what a black hole is or does to our reality. So fuck it, sure. He gets warped into a tesseract where the) *^(Power of Love)* ^(or cyclical/circular nature of reality, whatever, basically navigates him back to his daughter to somehow etch a binary message into watch hands ticking along through all time. Why the fuck not?)

^(Or hey, maybe he died and this was all his brain giving him one final show before lights out. Thankfully Nolan didn't leave any spinning tops for us to analyze this time so you can just make that the ending yourself if you want.)",-0.9496,neg,1,0

I thought this was so romantic and fun when I first saw it as a teenager. I considered it my favorite film for a long time. 

But it’s actually so grimy and dark. It feels so fun and exciting at first, hanging with musicians, talking about love of music, but it really shows how dark fame is and how screwed up our heroes can be.  

I remember thinking Penny and Russell were so romantic and tragic when I first saw it. But he didn’t give a shit about her and literally traded her for beer. The scene where William is asking her her age and she just repeats what he says, it’s so sad.

“Isn’t it funny? The truth just sounds different.”

The Christmas Adventurers feel like the Roman Empire wealthy, dominant, and blind to their own corruption. Lockjaw plays like King Herod, constantly grovelling for Roman approval, desperate to be seen as their equal but never truly accepted. Even the anti-immigration raids echo the suppression of early Christians crushing marginalized groups to maintain control.

Bob is raising a child that technically isn't his. 

When you line it all up, the whole movie starts to look less like a war story and more like a retelling of the New Testament through allegory. Do you think this was intentional, or just an over-interpretation?",-0.5906,neg,0,0

I’m sure Warners is always trying to improve, but if they couldn’t market it, nobody could.

This is a very *good* film, but it’s not readily marketable. I think the strategy is basically “make sure people know it exists, and count on the word of mouth.” Personally, I think it will be fine, and I think a good comparison is *The Northman*, which looks like a flop on the Box Office numbers, but the fact that people knew it existed meant it apparently made a *killing* on PVOD.

That said, I would not have thought *Barbie* was readily marketable, but they managed that in *incredible* fashion once they knew they had a very good movie to sell.

And this year, their marketing department’s work on *Sinners* and *Weapons* has been absolutely incredible. Marketing and advertising can be quite parasitic, but I know quite a few people who have fallen out of the habit of moviegoing but went to one or both of those on the strength of the marketing and had a sincere artistic experience, so I applaud them.",0.9641,pos,0,0

The idea that openly queer actors have an unfair advantage in the acting world is absurd. I’ll take Kate Winslet’s word for it over yours. https://www.them.us/story/kate-winslet-closted-queer-actors-and-pushing-for-change-in-hollywood

“I cannot tell you the number of young actors I know — some well known, some starting out — who are terrified their sexuality will be revealed and that it will stand in the way of their being cast in straight roles,” she explained to the Times. “Now that’s fucked up.”

The actress went on to talk about a certain well-known actor whose American agent recently told them not to publicize their bisexuality. “I can think of at least four actors absolutely hiding their sexuality,” Winslet said. “It’s painful, because they fear being found out.”

Winslet specified, too, that the problem affects “men more than anything.”

>Acting is acting, and unless you’re shooting a documentary or work of nonfiction then as long as hetero actors can act queer then those roles belong to them too.

That’s literally how it has always been in the acting world. What these openly queer actors are asking is for straight actors to be a bit more considerate when auditioning for roles that could help a queer actor raise their profile. Even in the Kate Winslet article I mentioned above, she acknowledges a queer role she had been recently cast in that didn’t bother auditioning other actors for the part.

“I’m done with not being honest about what my real opinions are,” Winslet explained in the interview, “and I know the [Ammonite] part was never offered to anybody else. In taking this part I had an opportunity to bring an LGBTQ story into living rooms.”Although Winslet feels ambivalent about potentially taking the part from someone else, she also knows how Hollywood works.

>Within the queer community, there is marginalization of gay men who are “heteronormative” and the concept of keeping sexuality private and behind closed doors is considered problematic / closeted / shamed thinking. You use the word “openly” which is key because again, non-hetero men who pass as straight still exist. I’m one of them.

When talking about openly queer actors, I’m talking about actors who have publicly come out of the closet, not about how heteronormative they personally behave. I’m not a flamboyant guy. But if I was asked if I’m gay, I would tell the truth. If anyone is trying to hide their sexuality from anything outside of fear of some retaliation or job security, I think it says more about themselves than anything else. You’ll never hear about a man who is ashamed to admit he is straight.

>Plus for someone who you suspect wants to hide his sexual orientation out of fear for his career, then picking a bisexual drag queen-esque role in Rocky Horror is probably the last thing you’d want to do.

I mean, you were the person claiming that Tim Curry’s performance in Rocky Horror was proof that hetero actors could play queer roles, right? Plausible deniability is 100% a thing. My grandma believed that Liberace was straight until the day she died.

Look, I don’t care if straight actors audition for queer roles. I just think they should realize that other talented actors often won’t be hired because they don’t hide that they are queer.

It feels like we're in agreement on some things but now there's like multiple points of contention but since the interview you posted touches on them I'll see if I can string it together:

> “I cannot tell you the number of young actors I know — some well known, some starting out — who are terrified their sexuality will be revealed and that it will stand in the way of their being cast in straight roles,” 

I dismiss this as paranoia, most likely the result of growing up in political bubbles in which they're told half the country hates them or whatever, that's why she specified young actors. Your average blue-collar joe watching a sitcom or movie isn't going to care that Neil Patrick Harris isn't actually banging women IRL. This is a fact.

> Even in the Kate Winslet article I mentioned above, she acknowledges a queer role she had been recently cast in that didn’t bother auditioning other actors for the part.

Because there's such a thing as marketing and the power of names. Audiences are more likely to see a Kate Winslet rom-com than a rom-com starring a no-name actress even if the premises are identical. Whoever made this movie clearly liked the look or acting style of Kate specifically. 

Plus the article seems to add to my point:

> While queer and trans stars like Kristen Stewart and Elliot Page may be the face of a newer, more tolerant Hollywood

More evidence that there is no discrimination thus no need to protect the roles. LGBT people are literally the face of modern Hollywood. However, the goal posts were then moved to men.

> Winslet’s intel checks out. Stars like Tom Hardy have seen public blowback after coming out as bi or even admitting to the odd affair with other men. 

Her intel doesn't check out, what was the public blowback? 12 mean comments on social media? He's not had to hide his sexuality and it has had zero impact on his career. Buff straight men with shaved heads have either dressed up as one of his characters or considered it at some point in their lives. Zero repercussions.

> coming out as bisexual or gay is seen as a career-killing mistake on the part of old-fashioned executives and casting agents.

This is conjecture and speculation, the key part is ""seen as"" because the writer is basically saying this is what the vibe feels like, not the true thoughts or policies of anyone in particular. 

> Plausible deniability is 100% a thing. My grandma believed that Liberace was straight until the day she died.

I said in another comment that part of me suspects he might be bisexual but I also know that's wishful thinking on my part. 

> Sean Hayes from Will and Grace has said he has struggled to find work since the show ended because of type casting and producers believing openly queer actors can’t convince an audience that they can play a straight role.

Is it really that unheard of that a star of a hit TV sitcom can't find work after? Being typecast by audiences is a thing that isn't really Hollywood's fault. It's kind of like how David Schwimmer will always be perceived as the neurotic dorky Ross. I think it's hard for people to break the association when you've seen that actor in a certain role again and again on a weekly basis on your TV. So in this instance since not only is he now joining the ranks of struggling TV actors, he's also permanently perceived as that character.

I kinda get why it sometimes goes beyond acting. Like if Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke with a soft lisp instead of an Austrian accent and was known as a flamboyantly gay dancer, he probably wouldn't have been cast as Terminator because a lot of audiences would've been like, *""I don't know if I can see him as a real threat""* thus not giving the film a chance. But since he had reputation outside of acting for his physique, this gave him an edge over more qualified actors who could speak without an accent. So ya, acting is acting unless there's something else going on about you that would help sell the role.",0.9181,pos,1,0

In my experience these companies absolutely want LGBT people first and foremost. If it's for writing, your entire sexuality must be core to your identity and what you'll bring to the table. If it's for acting, you need to *look* like you're LGBT which then boxes us into stereotypes. Like Tim I don't like talking about my love life and feel it's private, but in order to land these gigs, I'd need to fully out myself. 

And even that's another issue: what's to stop a straight actor from simply claiming to be LGBT? Are they going to have to prove it somehow? I think this sets an expectation that gays and lesbians need to *look* blatantly queer in a very stereotypical way in order to quickly communicate visually to audiences what your orientation is. 

I just simply don't believe the discrimination described is really present anymore and the fact that openly gay men and women have been dominating Hollywood for the last few years signals that orientation is of no obstacle. I think old school traditionalist Hollywood has largely been eradicated, which explains the drop in quality of films. Remember, you can't even qualify for awards unless the cast & crew meets diversity quotas, meaning LGBT people are only really chosen above all others to meet these requirements rather than chosen because we were the best choice available.

What the poll actually shows is that older people are more likely to watch older TV shows and movies, than younger people.

Personally I can confirm it's almost impossible to understand dialogues in modern movies without subtitles, because not only the audio is very quiet, the actors can't even speak to begin with, they are mumbling.

>From 20th Century Studios and the producers of “Barbarian” and “Weapons” comes “Psycho Killer,” a terrifying cross-country road trip starring Georgina Campbell and James Preston Rogers, directed by Gavin Polone, which opens in theaters February 20, 2026. 
 
>Following the brutal murder of her husband, a Kansas highway patrol officer (Georgina Campbell) sets out on a journey to track down the perpetrator. As the hunt progresses, she comes to realize the man responsible (James Preston Rogers) is a sadistic serial killer, and the depth of his mental depravity and his sinister agenda is more twisted than anyone could have imagined. The film, which also stars Grace Dove, Logan Miller, and Malcolm McDowell, is written by Andrew Kevin Walker and produced by Roy Lee, Matt Berenson, Andrew Kevin Walker, and Arnon Milchan, with Martin Moszkowicz, Robert Kulzer, Yariv Milchan, Natalie Lehmann, and Kat Landsberg serving as executive producers.",-0.9795,neg,0,0

Tangentially, this headline is an example of how online writing can be insincerely, or at least tediously, framed. A specific idea (""Leo is so funny here"") will gain traction on social media, including Reddit. Some writer with a quota to meet will then take that idea and try to present it like he's made some independent and esoteric discovery. 

And then a misleading title may be added, doing violence to whatever good intentions remain. I've been told writers rarely choose headlines, and this article makes that clear because the author says the following in the actual piece: 

>But there’s something else here, too, something about the way that DiCaprio’s style has changed over the years. Somehow, over the past decade or so, he’s become **one of our finest comic performers.**

Whereas the headline, likely imposed by an editor, makes it much more unequivocal to generate clicks.

But there is no world in which Jim Carrey (to name one example) is still alive and working -- or even one where he's *barely* working -- and Leonardo DiCaprio is the finest comic actor working today. Even a throwaway scene in Sonic the Hedgehog, of all things, would refute that.",0.9187,pos,0,0

DiCaprio does nothing in the movie but looked confused in a bathrobe.  Is he a capable actor?  Sure.  But more than anything, he knows how to play the Hollywood game to get the choice roles.  There are endless actors of greater skill who simply, don’t get called because they aren’t in the club.  
      Last Saturday, Sean Penn did a ridiculous interview for the New York Times Daily Podcast where he ranted about hating incompetence in others, while stating that: He hated school and should have been left to spend his days surfing in his youth, escaped justice in china for threatening to throw a reporter off a balcony, and respects Charlie Kirk for believing life begins at conception.  Penn will likely be offered an Oscar for essentially playing himself against Leonardo for doing the same.  
Is the movie good? Yes.  It was made by disciplined people like most studio movies. There was a lot to like about it.  DiCaprio was fine, but I can’t see Teyana Taylor with him, let alone loving him.  He just seemed to be chasing the hot girl well out of his league, because they chose to portray him as having nothing to offer anyone.  He wasn’t even a good father, dedicating his life to self medication.




Spoiler:  Did we need the extra time in a near 3 hour movie to see Penn die twice? It was pretty silly the first time (can you imagine the effect of one handed shooting a shotgun off in a moving car?).  There’s a reason why people don’t do this often in real life.

As Jeffrey Goines, a patient in a mental institution in 12 Monkeys. 

As Tyler Durden in Fight Club. 

As Lt. Aldo Raine in Inglourious Basterds.

As Mickey, the Gypsy bare knuckle boxer in Snatch. 

As Floyd, the stoner smoking out of a honey bear bong on his couch in True Romance.

There’s a lot more but those are the best ones that come to mind.  I respect Leo, especially his role as Arnie in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape.  His physical transformation and learning the native language in The Revenant was Oscar worthy.

Once more were grown domestically with methods that left them looking much nicer, the red coloring mostly went away.

""That'll do, Donkey "" is a reference to the 1995 movie ""Babe"" (""That'll do, pig"").

Shrek's selection of potential love interests shown in the mirror mimic the setup of ""The Dating Game,"" which debuted in 1965. 

Queen Lillian quickly backpedals on her disdain for ogres with a Seinfeld quote - ""Not that there's anything wrong with that!"" (originally used repeatedly by Jerry and George in an episode where they were mistaken for a same-sex couple).

In Shrek 2:

Fiona and Shrek's honeymoon beach scene famously contains three references. The second and third are more well known - ""The Little Mermaid"" and "" Jaws."" But the first reference, when the wave crashes over them, is a nod to the 1950s film ""From Here to Eternity."" 

(Incidentally, that movie is also found in a thinly veiled reference in ""The Godfather."" Johnny Fontaine is unarguably a movie universe version of Frank Sinatra, who had very thick mob ties. The director who Tom Hagen initially tries to reason with is basically a fictionalized version of ""Eternity""  director Fred Zimmerman, who - as the story goes - may have been coerced in a similar manner into writing a small part for Sinatra to play in the WWII-centered movie.)

The line ""Swimming pools and movie stars"" is lifted from the theme song to the 1960s TV show ""The Beverly Hillbillies.""

The Fairy Godmother pulls a Michelle Pfeiffer move from the 1989 movie ""The Fabulous Baker Brothers""  when she rolls around on top of the piano.

Puss n' Boots mirrors every single Antonio Banderas move from the 1990s film ""The Mask of Zorro.""

The Fairy Godmother's billboard is a winky reference to Hollywood hopeful Angelyne, who in 1984 invested a SHIT ton of money on billboards she hoped would lead to a lucrative A-list celebrity career. (They did not - though she was offered a number of less lucrative novelty gigs.) The billboards featured Angelyne in a saucy pose and bore no additional context - ""Angelyne Rocks.""

""Fine Corinthian footwear"" is derived from a 1974 Chrysler Cordoba commercial featuring ""Fantasy Island"" actor Ricardo Montalban, who enticed audiences to purchase the Cordoba by noting its seats of ""fine Corinthian leather."" There's no such thing, really. It was just regular ol' top -grain hide made to sound fancy by marketers.

One of the more obscure references is ""Hey, good lookin'. We'll be back to pick you up later."" This is a verbatim repetition of a line from the 1970s infomercial for Mister Microphone, which could turn a stereo speaker into a PA system... 😅

The slow motion hair flip and running through fields of flowers are confirmed references to shampoo commercial tropes.

They mention a bush that looks like singer Shirley Bassey, best known for singing the theme song to the 1964 version of the Bond movie ""Goldfinger.""

The White Bronco is a reference to the OJ Simpson murder case - the same car owned by Simpson's best friend, Al Cowlings. When the heat got too hot, OJ exhorted Cowlings to help him flee, but the move was not remotely lost on law enforcement. This led to the infamous ""low speed"" chase as a terrified and anxious Cowling crawled along the interstate at 35 mph, tailed by at least a dozen patrol cars while Simpson sat in the back seat with a gun to his own head, threatening to end it all then and there.

In humans, paraquat damages the mouth, stomach, and intestines if it is ingested orally.[6] Once absorbed in the body, paraquat causes particular damage to the lungs, kidneys, and liver.[6] Paraquat's lethality is attributed to its enhancing production of superoxide anions and human lung cells can accumulate paraquat.

The documentary is primarily framing it as ""an unfortunate war between brothers"" type deal, with honorable men on both sides. That was a very useful way of framing it if your goal is to downplay the Confederacy's actions.

To his credit, at the time, the decades of historical revisionism and southern lost cause strategy had shifted the narrative quite a lot, and no one was really questioning why there were Confederate statues everywhere or Confederate flags being flown. It would take 20 more years for this country to collectively push back on that. So he isn't so much sympathizing with he South as much as he is doing what he sees as his duty by presenting a ""nuanced"" historical take

It's just that a modern historian would, in hindsight, appreciate that nuance doesn't inherently mean a 50/50 split when it comes to who we sympathize with.

Once an actor wins an Oscar they pretty much can pick whatever role they want, and command a $20 million salary for their role. At least this is how it was back when Halle Berry won her Oscars for Monsters Ball.
The general public was severely impressed with Halle Berry in that movie. People couldn’t wait to see what she was gonna do next! 

And then…… she did Catwoman, possibly the worst superhero movie ever made. And the choices were only bad from there. I can’t remember who I talked to about this, but someone in the industry explained that she’s probably very loyal to a manager or an agent that doesn’t know how to pick a script to save their ass.

That made a lot of sense.

So now when I see an actor consistently playing bad roles in bad movies, even though they’ve been acclaimed for their acting skills at some point, I generally assume that they have a manager or an agent that keeps recommending them these terrible movies….

Seems like he's now typecast as the bad guy. He does a good job of adding nuance and bringing empathy to his characters. I loved his portrayal of Billy Russo in The Punisher. I hated the character while also feeling heartbroken for him at times.

I watched The Words a couple years ago and thought he and the woman who played his wife were phenomenal. He plays a character we see over some time. Falls in love, has a kid, and then life happens to them. It was endearing. I would have much preferred a movie with just the two of them. I hope he gets a chance to do another interesting character.",0.9657,pos,0,0

We're talking the top 1% of all actors. That's maybe 10-20 people, tops. And it doesn't last forever. John Travolta was the hottest actor in the 70s. Now look at what he's doing. 

Any actor can turn down any audition. But what people don't realize is that auditions are sparce to begin with. You don't book auditions based on your talent. You get auditions based on what you look like. Because casting directors are looking for types, not talent. Your gender, race, age, height, and weight are far more important than how talented you are. 

auditions become less and less frequent the more famous you get. Once your quote reaches a certain level, your agent will no longer accept any roles that are beneath that. You won't get called for auditions that only pay scale, if your resume far exceeds scale pay. Let's say you were a series regular on a sitcom. Like Wayne Knight (Newman) on Seinfeld. Even though Newman only appeard in like 40 of the 180 episodes of Seinfeld. He's now considered way too famous to be going out for auditions that are only paying scale, aka, the minimum wage for union actors. 

At a certain point, they don't even have auditions if they want someone of a certain fame level. They just start polling random people. If a casting director is looking for a famous black male comedian, they will literally just start surveying people on the street, who do you like better? Chris Rock, Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence, Kevin Hart, etc. And whichever actor receives the most votes, they will be offered that role. So if Chris Rock gets the most votes, they'll offer it to him. And if for whatever reason Rock decides to turn it down, then they'll offer it to the next highest vote getter. But given how scare these roles are, Rock wouod likely take the role. 

And the amount of roles you can audition for shrinks significantly. Unless you're willing to audition for something below your quote. But when you do that, that now becomes your quote. Because who's gonna pay you above scale, when you've been going out to auditions that pay scale?",0.9843,pos,0,0

>In Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Zootopia 2,” detectives Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who arrives in Zootopia and turns the mammal metropolis upside down. To crack the case, Judy and Nick must go undercover to unexpected new parts of town, where their growing partnership is tested like never before. Oscar® winners Jared Bush (co-director/co-writer “Zootopia,” director/co-writer “Encanto”) and Byron Howard (director “Zootopia,” director “Encanto”) are directing; Bush is writing the script; Yvett Merino (Oscar-winning producer “Encanto”) produces. “Zootopia 2” hits theaters in Nov. 26, 2025.",0.8439,pos,0,0

I guess I was hoping for more of a “yeah I did some horrible shit that I’m trying to put behind me cause I love you” thing rather than what appeared to be the complete regression into Joey we got instead.

This IMO was the entire point of the movie. 

My take is that as twisted as it is, the movie is a romance from start to finish.

The central question that the whole movie spins around is 'If you found out your spouse was not who they claimed to be, could you still love them?'

There's a telling line midway through the movie where Tom says 'I remember the moment I knew you were in love with me. I saw it in your eyes. I can still see it.'

The final scene is when he comes home after dealing with everything, he sits across the table and looks into Edie's eyes. The whole movie has built up to that moment, and it's left to the audience to decide what they think he saw in them.",0.9153,pos,0,0

Nightmare on elm street, the parents who killed Freddy starting the whole series of movies could argue they experienced trauma leading to their actions after they learned about what he was doing to their kids. 

First Friday the 13th is about a woman murdering camp counselors where her son was bullied and eventually died because the counselors didn’t look after him. Seems like trauma played a role there. 

In Halloween, Michael is literally in an asylum for murdering his older sister when he was 6. Laura is quite literally a victim of that trauma. Even in the later movies she basically isolates her house and turns it into a kill zone. 

In I Know what you did last summer, Ben Willis who the kids hit with their car was walking in the road after after killing and staging the suicide ofDavid Egan who he blamed for killing Ben’s sister.

But I don't mind the third act. For me it's the decisions depicted earlier in the film, though it's hard to remember for sure what bothered me. I think it was a mix between the decision 
>!to follow the distress signal and the make mistake to not just forget to align the heat shields or whatever it was. I mean I guess I could have lived with the first one, but barely. As I understood the movie, this is not some distant future where humanity is cruising regularly between mining colonies in the solar system. They barely scrape together the technology to bring this bomb to the sun. A change of objectives and course feels more like it should be impossible in this context, especially since one would think the teams who made this mission possible made sure this spacecraft goes to the sun and only to the sun.

Anyway, so they do it this way, fine, but I just cannot accept the whole process of the course correction which basically led to the downfall of this mission. I mean to me as the audience the whole mission and the spaceship itself feels extremely fragile, and no one has ever succeeded in this kind of thing. So then basically some crew member does this incredibly important task completely alone when NO ONE is around and he just .. forgets about an important step?? The whole maneuver should be highly unusual with the available experience of humanity in space faring and they're handling it like an everyday task that Chewbacca does on a Tuesday. So while the whole science fiction idea is great as it feels like the crew has to do Star Trek stuff (change course) with advanced Apollo 13 technology, the way they do it in the first place is just not credible enough for me and that just ruins the rest of the movie as I'm constantly thinking: yeah but that in the beginning was just stupid so I don't really give a shit about anything anymore.

What bothers me the most is that this could have been easily written in a different way. You make that stupidly dangerous decision to go to Icarus II? Fine, but then the whole crew should have to do overtime and make sure that everything works smoothly. You need something in the ship to break in the process so the stakes get higher? Fine, introduce a 2% chance that the heat shields might not align correctly because the ship is not built for that kind of mission. Furthermore, since the additional explosives that can be gathered on the Icarus 1 improve the success of the whole mission by say 60%, our crew of scientists decided to vote for the maneuver, which is not entirely credible but also not entirely stupid. And they make the experience, that 2% is still too much and everything from there on can be exactly like in the original plot including a crew member that feels guilty and so on.!<

I love how the crew is drawn to the sun knowing it will destroy them. It is horrifying and beautiful in its ability to destroy and to sustain life. I think the crew goes mad at the dichotomous nature of it.

I’m also very glad that Roger Ebert got to see it just before he passed away; his review should sell it to anybody, especially the last paragraph:

And what a leap by the directors, who free themselves from the chains of narrative continuity. And then the wisdom of the old man staring into the flames makes perfect sense.’",0.9844,pos,0,0

However, I still don’t find him an *amazing* actor, and when he takes on a more serious role his approach often feels a bit over the top for me. He tends to do *more* acting. Like ‘bigger’ acting, which can overpower the moment somewhat.

Michael Caine – The Cider House Rules



Tom Cruise – Magnolia


Michael Clarke Duncan – The Green Mile


Jude Law – The Talented Mr. Ripley


Haley Joel Osment – The Sixth Sense



I honestly think Osment should have won out of that lot. It was an incredibly memorable and moving performance to be delivered by a 11 year old actor and his performance is a big part of what made the movie a critical and audience sensation at the time.  Cruise was excellent in MAGNOLIA, but  the consensus at the time was that it was just an okay movie that he was the best performance in and that is what prevented him from winning. I think Caine winning was maybe the worst choice they could have made, but he was still very very good in that movie.


However the best supporting performance from 1999 wasn't even nominated and that was Al Pacino in THE INSIDER. He's just electric in it, but may be in it a bit too much to be considered supporting.  Very highly recommend that movie.",0.9935,pos,0,0

I’m not a big fan of Star Wars, but I can sit and watch a movie for dumb fun for a while no problem. I found 7 to be bad, a literal rehash of the original with little to no original thought. 8, while far from good, went in an interesting direction and I thought would be a possible turning point for the better.

Rise of Skywalker not only undoes everything 8 did, it’s just full of, honestly, completely stupid tropes and fake-outs and “references”. It falls on the same problems Crimes of Grindelwald did. It’s full of “hey remember this character? Well this is HIS DAUGHTER! MUAHAHAH”, and you’re just sitting there like “ok, would have been way more interesting if it was something new”.

Not only that, but if I’m not mistaken there are legit 3 fake-out deaths. It makes it all feel cheap and rushed. The whole story is honestly garbage and none of the characters get a satisfying arc. Would have much preferred the 8th movie line of “we are no-one” and of random people being allowed to be heroes, not having to be a nepo-baby to wield a lightsaber.",0.9814,pos,0,0

I really don’t care for implausible/impossible horror (like a house that comes alive and eats people) but when you have real people that absolutely could do the scary/crazy things like this, I am totally in. Great job. 

Loved that there was basically no nudity (as others in this thread have asked about), as there is no need. And, also just disappointed in the infantile comments/questions I have seen so far in this thread. 

Definitely recommend this film to all my friends, and most likely will go see it again in the theater with my adult kids

Obviously it's a movie, and the point of the scene is to show, broadly, how cruel and brutal warfare was (and is).

But, there was some logic to what they were doing. By and large, the soldiers of the British army of the period were professionals. That is, they ""volunteered"" and served long enlistments of over a decade. They had the advantage of a high degree of training and experience.

Also, musket volleys were largely effective to maybe about 100-200 yards. A disciplined infantry unit could cross that distance in probably two to two and a half minutes, potentially less depending on terrain and unit aptitude.

The movie shows the French firing more volleys than they realistically would have been able to, and the volleys have far more of an effect than they likely would have in reality. Don't get me wrong, men would die from every volley, but it would be a less dramatic amount per volley, especially at a distance.

The reason why the men advance is to engage with the bayonet. The bayonet was really what won battles. If the men broke ranks, turned, and ran, they were likely to get run down by cavalry and killed or captured. If they stayed in formation and pushed with bayonets, they were more likely to survive (and win) the battle. Meanwhile, if the other army saw disciplined men advancing with bayonets and weren't equally or more disciplined, they were likely to break rank themselves. So, there was a logic to advancing with bayonets.

This is also why cavalry was still used in this time. Cavalry could cross the 100-200 yard distance to infantry formations extremely quickly- often musket equipped soldiers could only get 1 volley off on a cavalry formation before the cavalry were on top of them. So, infantry would form ""squares"" when engaged by cavalry, which would help protect them from the cavalry.

But, the infantry squares were large and immobile formations that required great discipline to hold. Artillery fire was especially devastating to infantry squares, and round shot could potentially take out entire ranks of men. So, if you were a general engaged in a linear war, you'd move your artillery into places where you hope they'll be useful and unlimber them. Then, you use your infantry to push the enemy infantry into a place where you can engage them with artillery- you'd do this primarily with bayonets. Then, you hit the enemy infantry with artillery until they have to move again. When they do this, you'd engage with cavalry and hopefully route them. Or, if you couldn't get your artillery into an ideal place, you could charge them with cavalry and hope they'd break ranks from that.

This changed with advent of rifled muskets. A trained soldier could actually aim a rifled musket and make hits out to several hundred yards. In the Crimean War, Russian cavalry charged an unsupported Highlander infantry regiment, because conventional wisdom was that infantry by themselves couldn't effectively engage cavalry from far enough way to effectively stop them. Instead, the Highlanders fired at 800 yards and 500 yards and inflicted a fair number of casualties on the Russian cavalrymen, who broke off the charge because they were being fired upon effectively.

Incidentally, the British Army was actually very forward thinking with rifled muskets and it spent a lot of time training soldiers how to effectively use and aim rifled muskets. Even leading into WWI, British rifle training and marksmanship was some of the best in the world (which makes sense- they were a small nation with *many* colonial holdings. The British Army couldn't afford to throw wave after wave of men into enemy fire. The rifle gave them a huge advantage and was a key tool in their colonial endeavors).",0.6957,pos,1,0

That said, there were some experiments with *extremely* fast drill. This presenter talks about a military theorist who taught at West Point prior to the US Civil War, and he taught the cadets to do a [high step march at **165 steps per minute**](https://youtu.be/8u70Fj5pIpE?si=rmiJucL9pp8y4vd0&t=2196). I can't find video of that march, sadly, but that's insanely fast.

Like, when you have time, go outside and see how many steps you can make in a straight line in 30 seconds. For me, it was 70 steps in 30 seconds and I felt absolutely gassed. 165 steps a minute is practically running, and apparently the cadets hated doing drill at the run as well.

If you train a soldier so that he understands that his best chance of survival is to maintain formation, he will stay in formation as long as there is hope (and potentially longer).

Gibbons has published several books on muzzleloading firearms and military tactics from that era.

Bayonets, and charges with bayonets, were used because it was the fastest and least costly way to decisively end a battle. That clip above doesn't show the reality of the opposing line breaking from the bayonet advance. There's another critical thing the scene omits- smoke from the muskets. The French would not have been able to even *see* the British line from that position after their second or third shot from the amount of smoke that would have covered the battlefield, and needless to say, it's hard to shoot accurately at something you can't even see. And, very few (if any) line infantry companies would be disciplined enough to stand still and blind in a line to fire blindly at men with bayonets who were rapidly advancing. If they caught you while you were reloading (which you had to do after every shot) you'd certainly be dead.

> I truly wish that strategists of the period could have realized better ways to fight than marching in a line into a barrage of fire.

I do want to push back against this. I agree entirely that war is horrific and barbaric, and I don't want to give the impression that it's not. That being said, people in the past were just as smart, clever, and creative as we are today. And, ultimately, they wanted to win wars. Throwing the lives of men away for nothing was not a sustainable way to win battles and wars, and the militaries of the day coalesced on the tactics that worked best with the level of technology they had. Smooth bore muskets were useful weapons, but vastly limited and primitive compared to rifled muskets (and especially compared to rifles of today). Soldiers of the day were able to carry about 20-40 rounds of ammunition, and a black powder musket could only be fired so many times before it needed to be thoroughly cleaned. When looking at muskets, it's important to remember that while the weapon is a firearm, the most useful and effective part of that firearm was the bayonet. And, as discussed in that video I linked to, victories by bayonet often resulted in fewer casualties than trying to shoot things out from a distance.

One other thing I'd like to mention is that not all of the generals and leaders of the time were heartless monsters who threw away the lives of their men. Several times throughout his military career, the Duke of Wellington wept at the sight of his dead soldiers publicly.

After defeating Napoleon at Waterloo, the Duke told a friend, ""I hope to God that I have fought my last battle. It is a bad thing to be always fighting. While in the thick of it I am too much occupied to feel anything; but it is wretched just after. It is quite impossible to think of glory.""

Wellington was just one man (and a deeply flawed one at that), and other generals and leaders were certainly cruel and sometimes careless with the lives of their men, but by and large, these people were humans who tried to do their jobs to the best of their abilities. The tactics of the day may not make sense to us with our modern conception of warfare, but warfare at the time resembled fighting with pikes more than fighting with modern firearms.",-0.9882,neg,2,1

* Musket fire takes incredibly long time to drain the opposing armies numbers.
* A single catalytic bayonet charge will end a battle within minutes.

The video is understood, yet my point remains. I will elaborate a bit, that it took technology to highlight the absurdity of the line infantry. You can never convince me to walk forward into a hail of musket fire. Could you convince yourself to walk forward into a line of musket fire? It rejects any agency the individual has over their own life. Any other fighting doctrine at the very least gives the soldier some more autonomy over their survival. But walking in an organized line is simply rolling a dice to see if you will be the randomly selected target of the musket ball. That's the absurdity, being asked to play the musket-ball-death-lottery with each step forward you increase your chances of winning, or losing depending on how you look at it.

If you were required to pick any war doctrine/era to take part in, my last choice would be participating in a line infantry. Fighting against line infantry? Certainly. Guerilla tactics work great against a grouped and choreographed foe.",-0.1227,neu,0,0

But, years later, after watching the 2005 Dawn of the Dead remake, his song ""People Who Died"" played during the end credits. I thought the sun was cheeky fun and had no idea it was based on his life and people he actually knew. (Yes, it's in The Suicide Squad but my first exposure was Dawn of the Dead.)

More years later, some friends and I put this movie on to show a friend who hadn't seen it before. Hearing the song in the movie made me realize all the connections because when he sings about Bobby getting Leukemia, he was singing about his friend who was played my Michael Imperioli (of The Sopranos and Goodfellas) who had died early on in the film.

I never realized just how biopic the movie was but wasn't nearly as advertised because it only focus on the start of his addiction in high school. Not even my classmates or friends knew because people only ever talked about the scenes that stood out the most.

Historically, major fascist factions of early 20th century had some of the quirkier sects internally which naturally got folded into a simpler & uglier ones that we now know. One such example is Thea von Harbou who’s best known as Fritz Lang’s second wife. She was a fervent Nazi member who was also a massive fan of Mahatma Gandhi(?????) for some weirdest twisted reasons tied to core Nazi logic. (Something something Aryan origin in India and whatnot, can’t clearly remember)

Mishima Yukio and his fellow Japanese far right activists were even weirder. Their fascism is closely intertwined with traditionalist view that Japan should hold on its own against ‘the monsters and animals of US and UK,’ and the authoritarian aesthetics that finds the core of the traditional Japanese culture in Tenno/Emperor. Mishima’s famous debate with far-left National Student Movement shows this very well; they actually agreed on so many things but still parted ways because Mishima held onto the concept of Tenno as the manifestation of their shared idea.

Either way though, he was unapologetic towards Japan’s war crime in his pursuit of purity and idea, so as Japan’s neighbor I’d still call him a fascist. A very interesting one at that, hope contemporary ones could at least learn a thing or two from him, and I may actually like a part of him. But still a fascist.",-0.7594,neg,1,0

This was due to Disney being unable to trademark the name ""Zootopia"" in these territories for various legal reasons, including Danish Givskud Zoo registering the name Zootopia in 2014.

Biopics are already a frequently terrible genre, because it turns out that **people are not reliable sources for their own lives.** (That's why so many of them are based on *biographies*, not *autobiographies* to begin with.)

But expanding this to a brand, or a franchise, or a group of people who are very much alive, connected, and possibly even funding the retelling of their own story? It can't possibly be anything more than hagiography and corporate PR. And I've watched enough of them to check.

The Pop Tarts movie. The Air Jordan movie. The Flamin' Hot Cheetos movie.  The SNL movie. The show about making *The Godfather*. The *multiple shows* about how popular toys/movies/shows were made.

Hell, now we're even going an insane step further and telling **original stories about characters who are fans of existing IP.** The upcoming *Anaconda* reboot is about two guys wanting to remake their favourite movie: *Anaconda*. The new *Air Bud* movie is about a kid going through his late father's belongings and finding a VHS copy of the original *Air Bud*. I don't even want to talk about *Space Jam*: *A New Legacy*.

And this isn't even limited to Gen X/Millennial nostalgia or nerd culture! The reboot of *Matlock* **isn't even a reboot of Matlock.** It's about an unrelated woman working at a law firm in her retirement years, who (spoilers for a TV procedural) has actually created a *fake identity for herself* based on the old hit TV show, *Matlock*, which exists in this world.

Imagine you are the average American, worried about the future of the country, stressed out watching the news, and are looking for a little escapism at the movie theater. You are reading the synopsis of all the movies currently out and you come across this :

Bob is a washed-up revolutionary who lives in a state of stoned paranoia, surviving off-grid with his spirited and self-reliant daughter, Willa. When his evil nemesis resurfaces and Willa goes missing, the former radical scrambles to find her as both father and daughter battle the consequences of their pasts.

But as the story progresses, and we begin to realise how powerful the ""network"" and media in general are, he restrained the actors' blocking more, and forced them to be blocked to where the camera was.

In other words, the film starts with the actors' movement dictating where the camera goes... by the end of the film, the camera dictates where the actors stand and move, and becomes a much more passive observer of the characters.

It's such a subtle, but brilliant directorial choice, and even though your average viewer would never notice it, I strongly believe in the subconscious effect choices like this have on the viewer.

Lumet's book ""Making Movies"" goes into more detail about this and most of his films. Really one of the greats, and I still think doesn't quite get enough credit for how brilliant he was.",0.9556,pos,0,0

Okay, so even if it was brigaded (maybe the virgins didn't like Phoebe Waller-Bridge), why was Dial of Destiny's box office so abysmally low: $384M worldwide is terrible. That means MANY thought it was bad, or not worth an extra viewing. Also, watch out with the Audience Scores of RottenTomatoes. I recall Black Adam having 92% at one point early on, one of the highest DCEU audience scores ever, up there with TDK (it's since dropped to 87%, same as Dial of Destiny). We all know that's f'ing ridiculous for Black Adam to have 92%. If we accept there are basement virgins downvoting any certain movie (politics, hating on an actress, etc), could there equally be a contingent of fan voters who blindly give movies 10/10 just because they love the franchise? 

71% critics is also shaky. Positive, yes, but dropping 12 more % points and it hits Rotten aka No Recommend.

Last of all is the box office that cannot be ignored.  $384 million worldwide is so dismally low, it may have killed the franchise, at least for a long time - I call that a mission failure. It tells me people did not want to do repeat visits to this movie (for many it was not that enjoyable), or tell friends, family, coworkers to see this movie. Word of mouth was dead. I don't see any memes or quotes on social media from this movie. I can't even remember any character names, despite so many being introduced. It's not a classic Indy film for many, or certainly didn't penetrate the culture the way the OG trilogy did.

One cannot use the late 2023 COVID excuse either, because that year saw record-shattering box office all over the place. People were begging to go back to theaters: Barbie (over $1.5B worldwide), Super Mario Bros (over $1.3B), Oppenheimer ($976M), Guardians of the Galaxy 3 ($846M), Wonka ($635M), The Little Mermaid ($570M, and this movie was viciously attacked before the first trailer even landed and given a chance), and that shitty ass Ant Man 3: Quantumania *still* made $477M. John Wick 4 ($447M) and **Meg 2: The Trench BEAT Indiana Jones Dial of Destiny for crying out loud ($398M).**

No, Indiana Jones Dial of Destiny does not convincingly win in *every* metric, and that's why there's no word on any other IJ movie project or sequel from Mangold.

For some movies, you have to. I don't expect indie or award-winning films like Anora, The Substance, Killers of the Flower Moon, Banshees of Inisherin or The Zone of Interest (all great films imo) to do Avengers or Barbie money.

I *expect* (and so did the studio) a big budget blockbuster movie like Indiana Jones to do over $500M at least. In fact, if I said it would only do $384M worldwide long before the trailers came out, I'd be downvoted to hell for being a ridiculous hater and making up a fake number. ""Of course Indiana Jones will outdo that! This is a legendary franchise & character that attracts young and old! Crystal Skull even did $787M!"". And then look what happened...

Also, you don't [spend $400M on a movie](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2025/09/29/cost-of-making-indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-passes-400-million/) just to get back $384M (half stays with movie theaters, btw, so Disney really only earned ~$190M-$200M in revenue. Spending that insane amount of money and losing so much is poor, stupid, reckless business. Studios won't last if they continue doing that. That is why the resulting $384M gross was a massive, tragic disappointment. James Mangold even said [he felt hurt and down by the reception](https://deadline.com/2024/12/james-mangold-on-how-he-helped-timothee-chalamet-give-magnificent-voice-to-bob-dylan-1236194822/) (which means it was not universally loved).

>It was a very crowded and packed summer at the box office.

It was crowded for Oppenheimer too, a 3-hour movie with no action scenes and all talk. And it still did well. Also, Dial of Destiny actually had a free window for good business for a good 2-3 weeks. No competition at all and they could stretch their legs. Plenty of time to make insane money (Dead Reckoning, Barbenheimer would come out 2-3 weeks after Indy). Dead Reckoning, arguably, wouldn't even step on the toes of Dial of Destiny. People would likely see both, or the demographics are slightly different where one does not affect the other.

If crowdedness is the reason a movie's box office total is not what it should be, how does *any* movie succeed in the June-August summer months? And yet we still have movies earning $800M-$1B every year.

>What do you mean sequel? The movie was the finale.

Mangold may have said this was the final curtain, but Spielberg said that twice. Also, Indiana Jones reached out for that hat in the end, in a ""It's over...kinda, maybe.....no it's over.....unless?"". That hat is symbolic and iconic at this point. Reaching out to grab it again almost seemed to say ""the spirit for adventure will never die, I have more in me"".

I’m holding out hope for The Running Man, and while I’m thrilled that it’s going to be much more faithful to the source I’m concerned because the trailer looked like crap. It screamed Hunger Games ripoff for grownups, and while obviously TRM was written decades prior, the emphasis in the trailer on the show’s charismatic-but-smarmy host and the protagonist’s uncanny luck and witty one-liners rubbed me wrong and didn’t convey the deeper emotional themes in the book. Of course it’s just a trailer and is designed to draw unfamiliar viewers in, but it wasn’t gripping and didn’t get me excited for the film.

Is the idea that we all contain multitudes or that we should live life (and dance) even though we are going to die anyway? These are yes vaguely existential ideas but they aren't the same and so it felt like neither was explored fully

It's not like we see that much of what the realization at the end does for Chuck aside that one dance scene but it's heavily implied he's just been an accountant or whatever who hasn't spent his days valuing every moment.

I would have much preferred the movie be centrered on the multitudes thing, have Act 3 running through the film, include his relatives etc in that world, with the reveal at the end being: every person contains multitudes, other people, love, loss, joy, mundane moments and special ones and when they die it's like a whole universe dying with them.

I think the pass does generally solve the issue of ""being selective"". Assuming user has $25 per month to throw at entertainment, it's a great value that allows them to see pretty much everything they want.

That being said, and where I completely agree with you, is that it doesn't account for the experience itself just generally being costly. It doesn't account for travel, time or most expensively, snacks.

I still think it's a great option for someone who has close access to an AMC, and I would honestly suggest cancelling one streaming service to cover it. 

Then again, a huge part of the theater experience for me is way too much popcorn and a stupidly big drink. Even with the pass, you're still looking at $17 per visit for a large popcorn + drink. You'll accrue a free $5 reward every 2.5ish films you see if you order that each time. It works well for me but as you mentioned, doesn't really work for someone on a tight budget who also loves the theater.

Cinemark also has a similar program, but its one ""credit"" per month at about $11. The credit can be used for a ticket, or roughly $15 worth of concessions. That might be a better move?

Alternatively, would just suggest looking at budget days. My AMC has Tuesday / Wednesday shows at under $10 a ticket.

Unless the movie had major rewrites, this simply cannot be true.

>!Cregger's film takes place in the modern day. Bryan has a smartphone with a flashlight and apps. He calls himself a glorified Postmates delivery driver in the script, dating the story to after 2011. The film is not a 1998 period piece. It's fundamentally incapable of aligning with the game timeline. Now it's possible this could be changed in the final version. But I simply don't think that's going to happen.!<

>!The film opens with Bryan picking up a delivery at a hospital and driving on a snowy mountain road while talking to his girlfriend (who reveals she is pregnant). He is distracted, and hits a woman with his car. It's very Silent Hill Origins.!<

>!The problem is the snowy mountain road. That dates the film to sometime in November-January. Yet the film is supposed to take place BEFORE Raccoon is destroyed, which in the games is October 1, 1998. It's just not possible. The decade is wrong. The technology is wrong. The weather is wrong.!<

Anything Cregger says about how his film takes place at the same time as the games is the same kind of well intentioned nonsense as Paul W.S. Anderson saying that his movie takes place before the first game. (Which it can't because that game takes place around July 1998, while the film takes place ""at the beginning of the 21st century"".",-0.9822,neg,0,0

The final version of Weapons was broadly identical to the leaked script with only minor changes, so I expect the final version of Resident Evil will be the same.

I could see the ending >!where Bryan turns into a monster and eats all the other characters -- because he was bitten by an infected dog early in the film -- testing poorly and being changed. The film as a whole is basically a random horror movie with RE branding, but the ending in particular feels very mean spirited and unlike any previous RE adaptation. To be fair, though -- perhaps Cregger can make the ending work. That's the mark of a great director, and Cregger is such a strong, confident kind of director.

1nx0f0w,nhn6bpk,u/_Pyxyty,2025-10-04T00:50:48+00:00,1,"My only nitpick against it is that Hugh's character in the film (I forget the name) decides to suspiciously run off towards where he (correctly) suspected his daughter was being kidnapped in. I get it, it's his daughter, he wants to get there as fast as possible, he maybe even thought ahead and decided he needs to be alone to not cause the kidnapper to get suspicious or use the daughter as a hostage against cops.

Regardless, I hate that he just rushed off and made himself look so suspicious. He even deliberately ran off to escape the cops as well which just felt so unnecessary. If i was the father, I'd want to make sure someone else knows about the info I know, that I'd tell at least the lead detective on the case, that I wouldn't be the only one going there. Even if he was concerned that the kidnapper would use the daughter as a hostage if she's tipped off that cops are onto her, I would still at least tell the detective about my plan so that if things go sour, there's a Plan B, y'know?

It's my biggest nitpick, and I'm absolutely open to explanations that'd help justify this character decision, but at the moment it's definitely what prevents me from calling it a perfect movie.

So many cases of right and wrong, Focusing on how a guy thinks when in prison and how certain acts get justified. Andy goes from a straight arrow banker who did one wrong thing (getting drunk after a breakup), and gets involved with illegal kickback schemes, being turned into a pet accountant, and being involved in smuggling stuff into prison out of survival. He breaks out of prison, which is technically illegal, but it feels like the right ending for someone who was unfairly punished for something he didn't ultimately do.

And this argument is people missing the point. 

The redemption of the movie (and story) title is that of Red. Red did something truly horrific and he is the one who has to be redeemed. The mechanism for that is his friendship with Andy.

Andy is the virtuous lamb in an unholy place. If he were actually wicked - having killed his wife - then there is no value to the change he brings to Shawshank Prison and its inmates.

1nwmw7l,nhh43iu,u/LiteraryBoner,2025-10-03T02:08:27+00:00,41,"A good movie that feels deeply not for me, or maybe like it doesn't live up to the sum of its parts. It certainly has some moments and sequences that I loved and, as reported, The Rock is very good here, although I think the real star of the show is Safdie’s direction. That said, I went ahead and saw it twice because I was still wrestling with it (hahahahahahahaha) a bit and although I enjoyed it both times, it didn’t leave me with a strong feeling in the end. 

The Rock is, indeed, doing some real work here and that’s nice to see. I think Oscar talk is a bit insane for this as it’s probably the most in-his-wheelhouse performance possible being a biopic on a gentle giant MMA fighter. But he is absolutely putting forth a performance that clearly means a lot to him to be able to portray and while I never doubted that it was still The Rock under that nose, it is a compelling performance.

The score and the look of the movie are probably what I appreciated the most. There’s this low-key jazz score that kind of keys in when he starts to get really focused and almost ramps up continuously the whole movie until you’re in those final fights. The song choices are interesting but there is one scene set to the entirety of Jungleland by Springsteen that is just fantastic. Easily the best part of the movie, especially considering it’s not just a snippet of the 9+ minute song but a full scene that plays it unbroken in the background and acts out the highs and lows of the entire song.

I have a ceiling with sports biopics, most biopics really. It’s just so hard to balance good drama and real events and do all the things right you need to do with them while also trying not to do the things that every single one of them tend to do. For this one I had a hard time parsing out how it wanted me to feel about all of this. The story of Kerr losing for the first time and the spiral that sends him down is a great story and I have no doubt this movie is exactly what Safdie wants it to be, but when credits rolled I was just didn’t really know how to feel. Maybe it stands as more of a portrait of someone who was important to the sport and deserves more recognition, but it just didn't come together.

I did enjoy it scene to scene and while I think a lot of people will be quick to villainize Blunt (obviously not saying everything she did was perfect and great) it did feel like one of those slightly toxic relationships you see in life where every little thing is an offense but the fights make the good times burn a little brighter. Honestly I was more interested in Coleman played by Ryan Bader, interesting parallels there. He does it for his family while Kerr doesn’t want a family and seems to be generally against any sort of growth or movement. Of the people in Kerr’s life, the tragedy seemed to be that the person he wanted to be with was the one that didn’t know how to help him all the time. 7/10 for me.

The tech in question is to do with the capture process on onset work to help with virtual department work. It's interesting and has been actively developed and pushed forward through these films, but what has taken them so long to actually make is the post production VFX process.

With regards to Sharing the Tech, the above is what Cameron is talking about. The other tech, as in the water simulation work used by Weta and other studios in Avatar 2 and Weta in Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, is mostly proprietary ... but also just a case of massive amounts of individual work and resources crunching through iterations of simulations and working out how to render it all.

That part, the post production part, isn't owned or accessible by Cameron or the studios as it belongs to, and is the selling point for, the VFX facilities who have performed the work.

In that way you're sort of right, the R&D is a part of the process for those facilities, but that is not what is able to be made accessible to others and it also undervalues the pure artist hours involved in honing and refining these tools. 

The post production tools used cost tens of millions of dollars in VFX budgets to be accessible to feature films. And more like hundreds of millions when on these scales. Cameron's 'share the tools' would cover none of that.

One example I can give you off the top of the dome is in Mission Impossible - Final Reckoning, pretty much the entire or most airplane that tom Cruise is hanging off of is CGI, depending on the shot

did he do the stunts? Yes, but they have to make corrections for things they cannot do in-camera, and rather than spot-fix with simple vfx they just replace chunks or the entire thing with CGI

Another is in the previous MI film, there's a chase sequence with the funny-looking car Cruise is in, driving through an Italian town square. Many shots of that car are CGI

Also you should check out the dog in the most recent Superman. It's probably the most realistic, lifelike CGI dog ever. It's designed to look like an actual Super dog.

The original film crammed an entire novel into 104 minutes, completely rushed Eragon’s training, made Saphira grow to full size in like 30 seconds, and turned what should have been an epic coming-of-age story into a generic “chosen one defeats evil king” speedrun. They cut out entire characters, butchered the magic system, and somehow made dragon riding look boring.

A proper adaptation would be a series - maybe on the scale of early Game of Thrones. Take time to show Eragon actually learning swordplay and magic, develop his bond with Saphira properly, include all the political intrigue with the Varden, and actually explore the deeper themes about power, responsibility, and the cost of war. The books have this rich world with different races, complex magic systems, and moral ambiguity that the movie just ignored.

Plus, with today’s CGI technology, we could finally get a Saphira that doesn’t look like she was rendered on a PlayStation 2. The dragon sequences in House of the Dragon prove we can do this right now.

The reasons it was bad are seemingly insurmountable ones. A book largely about a gifted child's inner monologue and moral turmoil learning space-age military tactics - during which he beats multiple other children to death, including in a climactic scene where all children involved are naked - while his siblings, one of whom is a violent psychopath, plot and execute total world domination via a decade-long Twitter psyop, is basically impossible to make into a compelling film. 

Kids generally suck at acting, even kids that are good by kid standards, and the characters are too young to cast young-looking adults to compensate. They were on a hiding to nothing.

But also, the script was shit and made no effort to find a way to tell the story in an interesting way. Instead it just had Ender (poor Asa Butterfield) say all his expositional thoughts as dialogue, which breaks the Show Don't Tell rule, the golden rule of movie storytelling. ""I will wear the shame of this genocide forever"" is, to me, one of the worst lines of dialogue ever spoken in a blockbuster film. Don't tell us he's ashamed. SHOW US the shame.

And as a further pet peeve from a Kiwi, if they wanted to make Mazer Rackham Maori (book-accurate) and give him a traditional Maori facial tattoo, cast Cliff Curtis or Tem Morrison as Mazer Rackham. Don't put Ben fucking Kingsley in a moko, he looked ridiculous. It's a minor role. Cast a goddamn Maori actor.

IMO Requiem is a technical marvel and Aronofsky deserves all of his flowers for innovations in editing and that almost maximalist use of montage. The performances, as well, are fantastic all-around. But the narrative itself felt a little too on-the-nose for me. There’s little depth or arc to most of the main characters beyond “they start doing drugs and then EVERYTHING BAD THAT CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN.” (Burstyn being the exception.)

Even something slick like Blow hit me harder than Requiem, because it shows you the whole ride. You’re partying with sexy people while things are up and you understand the allure of the life. And when things start falling apart, it hits harder (for me) when it comes out in these smaller domestic things, like a marriage turning bitter, his mother turning against him, his father trying to give him all the love he can but knowing he can’t save his son (perhaps Ray Liotta’s finest performance), and his daughter wanting nothing to do with him.

Shane Black's style was on display and it works great with the heist plot set up. I loved the supporting characters in the movie, particularly LaKeith Stanfield and Chai Hansen's characters, but Mark Wahlberg as Parker was very underwhelming. He acts exactly like he has in every other action/comedy he has been in over the past 20 years and kills any chemistry the group had together. All I could think about when he was on screen was how much better Robert Downey Jr. would have been in the role had he not been forced to drop out because of Avengers. All in all, it was a decent Shane Black movie. Not on par with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys, or Lethal Weapon, but certainly better than The Predator.

There are some genuinely funny moments, and the violence is bordering on ultra-violent with how much gratuitous death and injuries happen. At one point a guy gets shot, set on fire, and electrocuted and I couldn't help but laugh at the poor bastard.

As for the ending, I know some people are going to take issue to....

>!Parker killing Zen. Like, everything was pointing to them hooking up or something but instead he killed her. Which I found surprisingly refreshing... exceeeeept... He didn't kill her, and the movie dropped some hints as to why he didn't. For one, we don't see it happen. Just a gunshot and he leaves the room. Maybe he shot her somewhere non-fatal like she did to him, to make things even? But the reason I don't think he killed her is when he talks to Philly's wife, he says he kept his promise and killed her... HOWEVER, he also has a history of lying about killing someone, like what happened with Kincaid. He knew Kincaid was alive but told Grofield that he killed him. He ALSO left Kincaid alive again when he passed out after being interrogated...!<

>!So, yeah I'm not convinced he killed her.!<

Overall the movie was a decent watch. I'm a sucker for heist movies with twists and double crossing, etc... So this was in my wheelhouse. It's not a 10 out of 10 masterpiece or anything, but I didn't skip ahead, which is already a good sign for me that I wasn't bored.",-0.956,neg,0,0

1ns4f92,ngj76zr,u/SanderSo47,2025-09-27T19:50:05+00:00,10,"In his [4/4 review from 1999](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-on-the-waterfront-1954), Roger Ebert had the following to say:

> look at the famous scene between Terry and his brother, Charley (Rod Steiger), in the back seat of a taxi. This is the “I coulda been a contender” scene, and it has been parodied endlessly (most memorably by Robert De Niro in “Raging Bull”). But it still has its power to make us feel Terry’s pain, and even the pain of Charley, who has been forced to pull a gun on his brother. Here is Kazan on Brando:

> “ … what was extraordinary about his performance, I feel, is the contrast of the tough-guy front and the extreme delicacy and gentle cast of his behavior. What other actor, when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something shameful, would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the gentleness of a caress? Who else could read `Oh, Charley!’ in a tone of reproach that is so loving and so melancholy and suggests the terrific depth of pain?”

> .........

> Schulberg’s screenplay straddles two styles – the emerging realism and the stylized gangster picture. To the latter tradition belong lines like “He could sing, but he couldn’t fly,” when the squealer is thrown off the roof.

> To the former: “You know how the union works? You go to a meeting, you make a motion, the lights go out, then you go out.” Brando’s “contender” speech is so famous it’s hard to see anew, but watch the film again and you feel the reality of the sadness between the two men, and the simple words that express it.

> “On the Waterfront” was nominated for 11 Oscars and won eight. Ironically, the other three nominations were all for best supporting actor, where Cobb, Malden and Steiger split the vote. Today the story no longer seems as fresh; both the fight against corruption and the romance fall well within ancient movie conventions. But the acting and the best dialogue passages have an impact that has not dimmed; it is still possible to feel the power of the film and of Brando and Kazan, who changed American movie acting forever.",0.9639,pos,0,0

In  scenes where they were interacting, and the camera went from one to another, Brando did not participate when only Steiger was shot.  So he could not act out the scene with him.

According to my not so good memory, Brando just did his lines and kept isolated from everyone else.

Steiger seemed relieved to get it off his chest.",-0.8353,neg,0,0

This movie could have easily been one note, but the way they escalate the racism stakes from the team to the parents to the townspeople to the institutions keeps it very watchable even if the structure is basically comedy beat - emotional beat - team losing - switch up strat - team winning. The pacing is pretty impressive. 45 minutes at Football camp, then it covers an entire Football season and zooms in on four or five games without feeling too repetitive. 

Denzel is immaculate in this. For someone who has basically never turned in a bad performance, this is exactly the kind of mid-tier stuff he was made to elevate to Godly levels. This might be his most iconic performance to me, obviously he has more important and better performances like Philadelphia and Malcolm X, but you can show Remember the Titans to a 10 year old and they'd understand the power of Denzel. He’s funny, committed, and he commands this entire movie in such a powerful way. Will Patton is also a bit of glue for this movie, he has a great arc where he has the most to lose by Boone staying head coach and he’s really not fully “in” on Boone until that game where the refs are making unfair calls. But the setup to the moment where he decides is him being present in all of the previous scenes, seeing what Boone does for these kids and his conviction. Also Coach Yoast is such a great name. 

There are also, like, eight other smaller performances in this that are incredible from the players to the parents. Bertiere's mom has, like, two minutes of screen time and is amazing? Her line reading of, “I don’t *want* to get to know him!” has stuck with me all these years and despite having basically no more lines still has two great scenes. There’s just so much room for everyone to contribute in this. I didn’t even realize Avon Barksdale was in this even though I had seen this movie five times before I had ever even heard of The Wire. Ethan Suplee has maybe never been so perfectly cast as this. Even child Hayden Panettiere is fantastic in this and has a ton of scenes with a range of emotions. Really, really well cast film and it’s probably its greatest strength. 

This is a classic for me and rewatching it was still as good as it used to be. Enough needle drops to break a stereo but a great soundtrack of half Southern Creedence and half The Temptations. It’s certainly not some heavy rumination on racism, but Shane Gillis was right when he said it’s about how important Football is in America, that only the high school team going 4-0 in Alabama could defeat racism. 9/10.",0.9978,pos,0,0

Also all the schools were integrated at the time. 

2) they should have just used the actual game script of the Marshall game and used the “you blitz all night” speech there. TC was down two scores in the 4th and came back and won on a defensive stand. It’s hard not to roll your eyes at a team who has scored 3 points all game, scoring on a 70 yard TD as time expires.

Gatsby does not need this extraneous flash, as the glitz and glamor is literally built into the story as-is. The contemporary music choices were jarring, and the movie's look was very bright and loud. This did a disservice to the garishness of Gatsby's parties, for instance, because there was no contrast - everything was dialed up to ten. There were no valleys, just peak after peak, and it and came across as inauthentic and forced.

The casting was simply okay. Tobey McGuire was probably the best of the lot, because his unassuming demeanor works well for the milquetoast audience surrogate that is Nick Caraway. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors, but I just didn't think he was right for Gatsby. He nailed the overconfidence of Gatsby's masque but I felt cheated out of the haunting loneliness and deep misery that should simmer beneath his gilded veneer. I think someone like Christian Bale could have done a much better job, though age-wise he might have been a bit old for it.",-0.2854,neu,0,0

Especially when Daisy and Tom go off at the end completely uncaring about the deaths that have happened. The one with the most humanity in the whole story is Nick. This reflects how they are in the novel, really. I've found that the issue most people have with the movie is how it tries to recreate the energy of the Jazz Age for contemporary audiences by using new music and flashy cinematics.

I hated it in theaters and continue to not get why everyone loves it. Its like a compilation of shitty people pretending they know what love is and mostly confusing it with infatuation. 

Prime minister character is basically just dealing with dating someone who everyone says is beneath him. They all keep calling her fat for some reason when she absolutely isnt. My suspicion is the script called for a much fatter woman and someone decided that wouldn't work in this shallow ass movie, so they casted someone with like...a bit of extra body fat.

Collin firth character is just infatuated. He doesn't know anything about the woman hes after and literally cant speak her language. Shes a hot piece of ass, so he must be in love.

Walking dead guy and Kierra nightly is the one that everyone says its legit not aged well and they're right. This guy's best friend is literally sneaking to their house to profess his love for the fiancee like a week before the wedding or some shit. Fuck all this ""I know we cant work"" shit, hes putting it all out there and laying a huge screw in the relationship. Whats his plan, just be their friend for the next few decades while quietly creeping on her and they both share that secret he wants to grt in there? Its honestly just as creepy that keirras character thinks its all endearing and doesnt immediately tell her fiancee. And super creepy all his pictures are like zoomed in on her face. Whole thing is just weird incel stalker vibes. No idea why people ever thought this was a sweet gesture.


The only decent example I can remember is the adult porn couple. They just seem like they are actually adults dating and falling in love. They get to know each other and enjoy each other's personalities. What a concept. The only reason the script thinks they're worthy of being in the movie is because its so quirky and funny they're adult film stars who happen to try to date.

The added scenes are nice, but again I don't feel that they are critical, and the extra effects bits with the demon face in a few spots feel clumsy and unnecessary.  Whhat makes the film so potent is that the effects are used pretty sparingly, so the mood of terror is built up more slowly but also more honestly.

It's a brilliant film, and it's worth looking up audience reactions from the time to get a sense of the seismic shift the film created at the time.  That the story is so grounded in reality in the beginning and then slowly, deliberately, and agonizingly strips away the logic of the world that we cling to makes ""The Exorcist"" a slow burn masterpiece for the ages

Fun fact for cinema fans of the Golden Era; the voice of the devil was performed by actress Mercedes McCambridge, who had a great career from 1949 through the mid-Seventies, and known by many as Emma Small from the gay subtext cult classic Western ""Johnny Guitar"" starring Sterling Hayden and Joan Crawford.

It is my favorite horror film, full stop, and one I sat through during an anniversary rerelease only to watch a bunch of younger people walk out bored. At the time I wondered why they didn't just rent the movie first.

As a showcase of the Kuleshov Effect, it’s… definitely that. Otherwise, it’s formally unremarkable. “Tedious” is not the word one should think of when sitting through a 70 minute horror film, but it’s amazing how restless this had me compared to a much longer film like OBAA.

I’d read at some point that it was basically “a dog gets Skinamarinked,” which I guess is true to an extent, but I expected something a little less conventional based on the comparison to Ball’s contentious horror film. Good Boy is definitely more commercial, but besides the remarkable performance that’s the heart of the film, everything else is pretty pedestrian. The effects, lighting, the frankly atrocious line deliveries from the human characters… it’s cheap and not in an endearing way.

It’s a shame bc this unique premise is just begging for an equally unique direction. Film it on film or video — something textured — make it B&W, cut down on the dialogue (or anything comprehensible to us but not the dog), don’t make the villain a frankly generic shadow monster.

Since the perspective is from the dog and the owner isn't going through his own thing, the movie was incredibly tense the whole time. The dog seems at best stressed the entire run time and it made for a stressful experience. Pet the dang dog Tod.

Then after Tod dies, alone and angry, Indy feels feels more like a spectator to the events than really having any agency in the story. I know its not like a dog can stop someone from having cancer but it's also a film about the supernatural, the whole endeavor just feels pointlessly tragic. 

My original thought coming out of the movie was that it would have been better to the premise if Tod lived through the movie. You still can keep the idea that its impossible to tell if this is real or what the dog thinks it's imagining.

>The film is often cited as featuring one of the greatest car chase sequences in movie history. The chase involves Popeye commandeering a civilian's car (a 1971 Pontiac LeMans) and frantically chasing an elevated train on which a hitman is trying to escape. The scene, coordinated by Bill Hickman, was filmed in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, roughly running under the BMT West End Line (now the D, ​R, and ​W trains, then the B train), which runs on an elevated track above Stillwell Avenue, 86th Street, and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the 62nd Street station. At that point, the train hits a train stop but is going too fast to stop in time and collides with the train ahead of it, which has just left the station.

>The scene's most famous shot is from a front bumper mount and shows the streets from a low angle. Director of photography Owen Roizman wrote in American Cinematographer magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed; this effect can be seen on a car at a red light whose exhaust pipe is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss Doyle's car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred that were left in the film. Friedkin said he used Santana's cover of Peter Green's song ""Black Magic Woman"" during editing to help shape the chase sequence. The song does not appear in the film, but the chase scene ""did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the music"".

>The scene concludes with Doyle confronting Nicoli at the stairs leading to the elevated train track and shooting him as he tries to run back up them, as captured in a still shot used in a theatrical release poster for the film. Many of the police officers who were advisers for the film objected to the scene on the grounds that shooting a suspect in the back is murder, not self-defense, but Friedkin stood by it, saying he was ""secure in my conviction that that's exactly what Eddie Egan [the model for Doyle] would have done, and Eddie was on the set while all of this was being shot"".

The scenes at Joliet Prison were at a still operating prison complete with Illinois Department of Corrections uniforms and patches.  The driving through the mall was a real life mall (albeit abandoned in the 70’s) they decorated. The Illinois State Police cars were old cars set for sale and demolition.  The use of Chicago Fire and Police Departments with their naval and mounted units were genuinely there.  It was the first major film to incorporate both state and multiple municipal assets in the making of a film in Illinois, this does not happen.  Even today to get all these agencies to work together in this capacity would require not only the cooperation of both the governor, secretary of state, multiple mayors and county officials but also a good deal state staff to allow being involved in looking foolish.  This on top of driving through downtown at dangerous top speeds and filming in areas like Maxwell Street before gentrification, having both the bands and the other top talents on screen who for many was their first time.  Then there’s the behind the scenes legends, many of which have been documented.

It may not seem like it but this crazy movie is a fascinating time capsule, lightning in a bottle that sadly won’t ever happen again.  Embrace it enjoy it and then listen to some blues music afterwards.",0.8298,pos,0,0

And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
And sore must be the storm -
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm -

Superman is just full of them. They cut out an entire section where Lex Luthor sets traps for Superman on the way to his lair. It has finished FX footage and everything. First Luthor unloads numerous machines guns on him, Superman walks nonchalantly as bullets bounce and ricochet off him. Then Luthor “turns up the heat” has flames shoot out at Superman. Superman keeps walking, inching ever closer to Luthor lair. Finally, Luthor attempts to freeze Superman. He activates these huge wind/cold machines. Snow and ice fly around, and we start seeing the ice building up inch by inch on Superman until he becomes encased in a solid block of ice! Luthor thinks maybe, just maybe, it worked. Alas since Superman is, well, Superman, he breaks out of his icy prison and enters Luthor lair. 

Thankfully Donner put this and other cut scenes back into a “special edition”. I remember seeing it for the first time thinking “why in gods name would you cut this? We get to see bullets bouncing off the Man of Steel! Flames having no affect and finally seeing him encased in ice”. 

Yet he keeps the “Can you read my mind” poem Lois recites during her flight with Superman. One of the biggest “what the hell were they thinking” moments in a film that nearly ruins the entire movie.

------------------------------------------------

Hi reddit! We're the filmmaking team behind DREAM EATER, a new found-footage horror film out in theaters October 24th.

Here's the trailer for our film:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivl9iXq98TU

About Dream Eater: 

During their holiday at a cabin deep in the snowy Laurentian mountains, Mallory documents her boyfriend Alex’s violent parasomnia. When his sleepwalking gets worse, Mallory suspects the cause may be something far more sinister than a mere sleep disorder. Using her expertise as a documentary filmmaker, Mallory digs into Alex’s shadowy past and begins to unravel a decades-long mystery steeped in trauma and the occult. As darkness closes in, an ancient evil awakens – plunging the couple into a downward spiral of madness and horror that threatens to destroy more than just their relationship. By the time the end credits roll, DREAM EATER will have you questioning who you’re really sleeping next to at night.

Favourite found footage films:
 REC (one of the most intense films ever) 
Paranormal Activity (probably the most scared I ever was in a theatre) 
The Blair witch project (it started it all) Paranormal activity 3 (fun innovative way to prequel the original. Also extra points for casting a member of the Harvard Sailing Team)
 The visit (this one just for the under the house and diaper scene) 
 Milk and Serial (phenomenal film that was absolutely chilling) 
Noroi: the last curse (an amazing FF in its genius format changes and it’s very satisfying ending)

Favourite non found footage horror films: 
Black Christmas (1974 - the scariest film of all time) 
The Shining (the GOAT) The Exorcist (the other GOAT) 
The Frighteners (one of my all time favourite films and easily Jackson’s most Slept on triumph) 
Death Becomes Her (more of a fantasy comedy but I’m cheating) 
Oculus (Flanagan at his absolute most deadly!!!) The Thing (paranoia at its peak)
 Jaws (no explanation required)
 So many more but I can’t seem To remember!!!

1nthwc2,ngwwzdk,u/DreamEaterAMA,2025-09-29T23:05:38+00:00,2,"u/Bubbly_Resort_Spa such good questions!!! I'm loving it. So I have a few answers to this. I'll try to go in order of when they fucked me up.  
1. JURASSIC PARK - When I was 4 my Uncle Terry (who was instrumental in my filmmaking journey as a kid) showed me Jurassic Park when he was babysitting me (against my parents direct order) and I had nightmares for weeks. It's still a topic of conversation that comes up at family dinners where he gets reamed out my by mother.

2. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - I remember seeing the original VHS artwork for this at my local Videoflicks and became obsessed with it. My mom wouldn't rent it saying the film was disgusting. That made me want to see it more. I didn't see it until I was about 10, but the 6 year old me holding that VHS in the store still gives me chills. 

3. IDLE HANDS - In 99 when Idle Hands came out, I remember my parents brought it home in one of those new at the time AWFUL VHS rental cases that had that thick black lock at the bottom which was impossible to open. And I remember they told me there was no way I was allowed to watch this which just killed me because I just loved the trailer and was obsessed with the leatherface reference that Seth Green did in the trailer. So against their wishes (and my better judgement) I snuck downstairs when I heard them put it on and watched from behind a couch. It took me less than 5 minutes to scream in terror when Anton's mom is pulled under the bed and brutally murdered. It's still one of my all time favourite films and is criminally slept on in the cult movie conversation. 

4. BLACK CHRISTMAS - When I was about 10 my mom showed me this cause she was sick of watching age approproiate films for me. This changed my life. I owe her so much. 

5. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - Then she finally let me watch TCM. I owe her twice.

When crafting our films, we start with the characters first and filter the premise through them so that way the horror is always something that deeply affects the characters personally, rather than just being for the sake of scares.

Because of this... I'm gonna give you several answers.  
  
1. 3 FILMS THAT ARE AT THE TOP OF MY LIST AND CAN WATCH AT ANY TIME (I prefer this island to be quite large with places to explore)  
Zodiac, LA Confidential, Hot Fuzz

2. 3 FILMS THAT I AM OBSESSED WITH AND WANT TO WATCH DAY EVERY DAY (this island can be small cause I'd be by the TV anyways)  
Death Becomes Her, The Frighteners, Mouse Hunt

3. 3 FILMS THAT I COULD LITERALLY LEAVE ON REPEAT AND HAVE SEVERAL TIMES  
American Movie, Half Baked, IRobot (no idea why but this movie just fuckin rocks my socks off)

BEST PIZZA TOPPING: Pineapple (I know Mal is gonna say it's the worst)  
WORST PIZZA TOPPING: I see some people be putting asparagus and broccoli and trying to trick their brain into thinking their getting their veggies but I'm a realist. So i'll say those (but I'd still eat it without complaining)

The ending to that film is absolutely terrifying and I've always wondered what happened after the police came back to check in on Olivia Hussey!?!?!?! So I'd want to make a movie that's a continuation of that story the next morning when the police come back to the sorority house to check in on her. I would cast Bill Skarsgaard as the silhouette for Billy and I would continue Bob Clark's style and creation of the voice of Billy by using several different actors in post to create his haunting phone calls. For the detectives, I'd cast Jason Bateman as Lt. Ken Fuller, Justin Long as Jennings, and Will Arnett as the laughing detective because I'd have no issue directing his reactions to Bateman.

Vigo Vasquez is a pseudonym that we use that represents 2 of our favourite film characters (bonus points for anyone who can guess which characters and what movie they are from!) which is a huge advantage when we are writing. We write to direct to edit the film so we are incredibly conscious of how we are going to piece the entire film together as we are constructing the scene on the page, and the same goes for when we are storyboarding. Similar to how Damien Chazzelle describes his process - we know exactly where the camera will be in any given line of the script. To add to that, we are very conscious of flow when constructing the edit so there were actually a small handful of scenes that once we saw it in the cut, we realized that even though we liked the scenes they were stunting the flow. We were very cognizant of wanting the audience to feel that there was never a dull moment in the film.

When I was leaving college I was placed into an internship in Ottawa, ON (Canada) on a film set as a Camera trainee and there was a 2nd AC who treated me so poorly that he embedded something in me - To treat everyone on set with respect. No matter what your position is, whether you're at the top or you're at the bottom - always treat everyone with kindness and respect. You don't have to be here... a life in film is chosen.

But outside of FF we are hugely inspired by the films of William Friedkin, Stanley Kubrick and pretty much everything by Mike Flanagan on how to craft scares while never losing what matters most: the characters.

In terms of dream scenes from movies, there are actually so many! The Gate has some truly amazing sequences, Nightmare on Elm street is obviously the GOAT, anything by David Lynch you could argue is a dream sequence, and special shout out to Wayne's World xoxo.

First off: It seemed like a love song to Sean Penn. He's a great actor, but I started to feel little sympathy for him during many of his scenes. The scene in which he and his brother are up late at night getting stoned and the step-father comes out to confront them - I was all for the step-father.  
Second: As good as Walken is in this film, he bears absolutely no resemblance to the true character he played. I know that's never a game changer, but when basing a story on true events, I think it's safe to get close to those true events. I found it hard to believe that Walken would be someone who would xxxx his son's girlfriend. 

On the other hand, the good stuff: I don't involve myself with rural crime rings, so seeing this one was a new experience. I'm glad it took me there. The acting of everyone involved is excellent. The music is top notch, and the directing and editing absolutely superb.",0.9951,pos,0,0

Walken is very uneasy about guns, and wants any gun that's going to be used in a scene with him - especially one pointed at him - to be in his control until the camera rolls.  Penn knew this, so stopped mid-scene and grabbed a different gun from the prop table.  It made the scene so much better, because Walken's reactions were all genuine.

But let’s just say, Evan Hanson makes some *terrible* decisions to drive the plot that seem creepy if Evan isn’t a believable teenager. Spoilers if you don’t plan on watching + mental health trigger warning: >!Evan is in therapy because he attempted suicide. He later meets an outcast kid named Connor in the library the day before Connor kills himself. Connor’s parents assume he and Evan were best friends, and Evan lets them think that to comfort them. But the lie gets out of control and Evan even starts dating Connor’s sister.!<

Just saying the plot makes you question why this musical was ever successful. However, as an audience member, you empathize with Evan because he’s a broken, misguided teenager. And the casting of the other characters makes you realize that either everyone else is kinda lost and barely hanging on, or else being performative about having it all together. You can see why this show is big with teenagers.

The whole story hinges on a pitiful but likeable lead. I DNFed the movie because all I could see was Tony-winning Ben Platt trying to shrink his theater kid energy down to the high school hallway set.

So these non-professional-singers sang the songs without a set tempo, which meant the tempo wandered all over the place.

IIRC,  the shimbleshanks number **worked** because the actor was a dancer who **wanted** the ticker, so everyone stayed together on the beat and the beat was consistent.

After having to sit through it in school, though, I found that I liked the music and gradually ended up liking the film, its awareness of what it was doing, the actors, references to the original show.

I more relate to Calum, in that I have a 9 year old daughter but I don't struggle with the things Calum is shown struggling with.  But the universal theme is the question, as a parent, ""how will I be remembered when I'm not here anymore?""  What will my daughter think about as she reflects on her childhood?  Will it be confusing, fondness, fear, or warmth?  It's such an incredibly powerful film where less is way, way more.  Very little dialogue.  Even less of a plot.  Yet I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks after watching.  11/10 for me.

A few things:  regarding your statement that Calum committed suicide after their vacation together.  I'm not sure if you were implying it happened *right* after or just simply at some point later in time; if the former, I'm not sure we can make that assumption.  Also, I don't know if we can assume that his breakdown triggered a trauma, or if he's just overwhelmed by the relationship he has with his daughter, distilled into an intensity by the birthday celebration.  Occasionally my daughter will display some minuscule sign of affection toward me that just overwhelms me in way that's both joyful but also melancholic.  Of course, it could be trauma as well, but I didn't read it that way.",0.6083,pos,0,0

Two years on, I revisited it after hearing praise on a podcast I like, thinking I must have missed something. One major life change in those two years: I became a father to my first child, a daughter. I don’t think I need to explain any more about why this viewing was different, but I teared up throughout and was just blubbering by the end.

Here are a few I can pretty much recite: (I'll be putting a quote from each in parentheses also, just to sort of test myself.)

The Lion King (Whats that supposed to mean, anyway? It means you are a babboon, and im not. I think youre a little confused. I am not the one who's confused...you dont even know who you are!)

Lilo and Stitch (I cant give pudge tuna. Do you know what tuna is? IT'S FISH! If I gave pudge tuna, I'd be an abomination!)

My Neighbour Totoro (There was a little one, and one this big, and a grreeat big one, sleeping by himself!)

Hudson Hawk (If the Mario brothers weren't New Jersey's 3rd largest crime family, I'd say kiss my ass. Considering your status, I say, slurp my butt!)

Die Hard (You have me at a loss. You know my name, but who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child? Another ophan of a bankrupt culture that thinks he's John Wayne?)

Haggard (maybe you could use like...your own ass. Jerk the f**k off to that or something.)

Star Wars epsodes IV/V/VI (you've never heard of the Millenniun Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs! Ive outrun imperial cruisers!)(come on admit it, sometimes you think I'm alright. Occasionally, maybe. When you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.)(You are a protocol droid, are you not?)

The Girl Next Door (that f**king bitch cant just RUN AWAY, cause she don't wanna f**k on film no more!)

The Big Lebowski (My art has been commended for being strongly vaginal, which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina.)

Old School (You better pull that shit out man. That shit is not cool. Huh? Pull what out? You got a f-ing dart in your neck, man! You're crazy. I like you, but you're crazy.)

Pulp Fiction (everybody be cool, this is a robbery. If you f-ing pricks move, then I'll execute every motherf-ing last one of you.)

Reservoir Dogs (I tagged a couple of cops. You kill anybody? A few cops. No real people?)

Clerks (which did you like better, Jedi or the Empire Strikes Back? Empire. Blasphemy. Empire had the better ending! Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader's his father, Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. That's what life is, a series of down endings.All jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.)

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (15 bucks, little man. Put that shit in my hand. If that money doesn't show then you owe me owe me owe. My jungle love...oweeoweeo)

Mallrats (You want me to tell my mother what we do here at night? What that you play video games and I fall asleep unfulfilled? Go ahead.)

Dogma (Wait a minute, you knew Christ? Knew him? Shit. Ni**a owes me 12 bucks!)

There are probably even more Kevin Smith ones. Oh Chasing Amy! (Bitch, what you don't know about me I could just about squeeze into the Grand f-ing Canyon. Did you know I always wanted to be a dancer in Vegas?

But he defended all these moron clients who were getting rich. He figured he was smart, he knew he law, if these morons could do it, he could do it better. 

Remus memorized the prohibition laws and found loopholes whereby he could buy distilleries and pharmacies to sell liquor to himself for “medicinal purposes”. Then he’d have his own guys steal his own liquor so that he could sell it illegally. 

He ended up purchasing a lot of America’s largest distilleries and became known as the “King of Bootleggers”.  He got super rich and threw crazy lavish parties giving guests diamonds and cars as door prizes.

Finally he gets in trouble, but only gets a slap on the wrist and has to serve 2 years. In prison, he befriends an undercover prohibition agent named Franklin Dodge (who was there to get more dirt on him). Remus tells Dodge that he put his wife in control of the whole operation and all his money.

What does Dodge do with this info? Why, he goes and fucks Remus’ wife.  Then the two of them liquidate all of Remus’ money and assets. By the time Remus gets out of prison, he’s absolutely broke. He files for divorce. 

On the way to court for the divorce, Remus spots his wife. He runs the car off the road, gets out and shoots his wife dead in front of everybody.

Plot Summary:

  
In 1629, the Dutch merchant ship Batavia sets sail for the East Indies, carrying dreams of wealth and adventure. But when the ship wrecks on a desolate reef in the uncharted Australian waters, the survivors’ fight for survival descends into chaos. Led by the charismatic yet ruthless Jeronimus Cornelisz, a mutinous faction unleashes a reign of terror, pitting desperate castaways against each other in a brutal struggle for power. As hope fades, a small band of unlikely heroes, led by soldier Wiebbe Hayes, must rise to defy the madness and fight for justice. Based on the harrowing true story, Batavia's Curse is a gripping tale of betrayal, courage, and survival against impossible odds.

August & September of 1921, Appalachian coal miners have been getting screwed by company towns and coal barrons. Men die every day digging for coal that feeds industrialization. Miners begin to ralley under the United Mine Workers (UMW) to improve conditions, or even escape conpany towns. The coal companies retaliate with contracts forbidding unionization, violence and the deployment of a private army of ""detectives"" to put the miners in their place. 


8,000 union men march to liberate themselves and aid other sites. The companies like Logan Coal call in reenforcements, local PD, and West Virginia State Troopers. There is an all out, 5-day battle between the union and the coal/state bastards. The climax is when President Harding deploys Army aircraft to drop bombs on the miners. Estimates show about 150 men died to prop up the power of coal. West Virginia is still owned by those same interests (names have changed, but the structure is the same). 


After the battle 1000 miners were arrested, most were acquitted of treason and murder but not all. The leaders seem to have mostly gotten away, skipped bail, fled, or dodged sentencing one way or another.
