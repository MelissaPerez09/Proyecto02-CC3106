1nrrt9s,Movies that were only made so that the studio could keep the rights to an IP,u/AporiaParadox,3006,729,2025-09-27T10:27:09+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1nrrt9s/movies_that_were_only_made_so_that_the_studio/,True,[],"Licensed movies have been a thing for over a century, studios or producers make a contract with the owner of an IP to make a movie based on their property. As time went on, things got more complicated, especially since movies based on established IPs became more valuable. Sometimes, a studio would get the rights to a movie, but then not actually make the movie by the time the rights would revert back to the owner according to the contract. As such, sometimes a studio would make a rushed movie it otherwise wouldn't want to make just so that they can keep the rights, either so that they can make a better and more profitable movie later, so that they can then renegotiate or sell the rights to someone else, or just out of spite because they don't want another studio to get the rights.

One of the most infamous cases of this is with the Fantastic Four, it happened to it twice. In the 90s, Constantin Films made a rushed Fantastic Four movie just so that they could keep the rights, but never had any real intention of promoting it or even releasing it, because the contract only said the movie had to get made, not that that it had to be released. Over 20 years later, Fox would similarly make a bad Fantastic Four movie solely so that they could keep the rights and prevent Disney/Marvel Studios from using the property. Not that it mattered since a few years later Disney would simply buy Fox.

A much older case is The Hobbit. A producer had the film rights to Tolkien's work, but couldn't get a proper movie made in time before the contract expired. As such, they made 12-minute ""animated"" film (actually just picture book drawings with minimal movement and narration) based on The Hobbit and showed it once in a small theatre in Manhattan, thus preserving the rights. Tolkien would have to pay him 100,000 dollars to get the rights back. It has to be [seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnVL1Y2src) to be believed.

And then there's Dick Tracy. Ever since the 1990 film, Warren Beatty has kept the film rights to Dick Tracy. Every few years, he releases a short ""film"" or TV special that's basically just him dressed up as Dick Tracy talking in order to meet the minimum requirements to keeping the rights to the IP. He just doesn't want anyone else to have the rights as long as he lives it seems.

So what other movies were made solely so that someone could keep the rights to an IP longer?",movies,80,20,16,44,2,0,0.579

Take Jaws for example, the famous scene where Quint crushes the can of beer in his hand.  I didn't realize until someone pointed out to me that beer cans were much thicker and were made of steel instead of aluminum.  They were difficult to crush unlike modern cans and doing so was seen as a genuine feat of strength.

Or something else I recently learned was that there was also an old etiquette rule where men who were seated would stand up if a woman entered the room out of respect.  This is now an outdated custom which has been in decline since the ~~90s~~ 70s.  

I'm sure there are some people who might still do it especially in more formal settings, but at 25 this is a rule I was never taught.

This is a movie that ""I've been meaning to watch"" pretty much ever since it came out. I remember being in grade school and seeing the trailer and thinking ""that looks cool, I should watch it"", and then I never actually did. From time to time the movie would pop up somewhere and again I'd think to myself ""I should watch it"" and then I'd forget and years would go by again. Well yesterday was finally the day I sat down and watched the film and I was honestly blown away. I seriously did not expect it to be that good.

For starters I am a huge sci fi fan, and usually I tend to gravitate towards realistic, ""hard"" science fiction as much as possible. Think of the Martian, The Expanse, Gravity, Apollo 13, etc, stuff that tries to be as realistic as possible. That being said it's not like I don't understand the concept of creative license and I do believe that the story always takes precedence over technicalities and realism. 

Sunshine is a bit weird in that regard because part of it is very grounded and realistic while other parts of it are pure fantasy. While a bit jarring at first while trying to figure out where the movie stands exactly on that regard, it was absolutely the right call for them to make. The story is gripping, engaging, and the feelings and emotions are masterfully conveyed to the viewer mainly visually rather than dialogue. Which leads me to my next point, the visual effects for this movie are incredible. It's hard to believe it came out in 2007 because it puts many modern movies to shame. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised because the late 2000s were a golden age in terms of VFX as the convergence of classic film making effects and CGI came together in the best way, with film makers using each to their strengths while using each other to cover their weaknesses. This is in contrast to today where there is often an over reliance on CGI. 

This movie was made for only 40 million. That was a more hefty sum back then in terms of a movie budget but by today's standards that's low budget. And yet you would never call this movie ""cheap"". The set design is impeccable, the CGI is impeccable, the practical effects blend seamlessly with everything, and of course the story is the real star of the show, keeping you engaged and pulling you into the mind of the crew throughout. 

Go watch the film now. ",movies,80,36,5,39,2,0,0.884

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-1236385949/):

>What lingers as the end credits roll is Daniel Day-Lewis’ noble face — full of sorrow, resentment, guilt and shame, emotions that Ray spends much of the early action masking in hardened indifference. Regardless of the film’s shortcomings, it’s a thrill to have this giant of an actor back on a movie screen, hopefully next time with a more satisfyingly fleshed-out screenplay.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/28/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis) (2/5):

>The younger Day-Lewis shows promise as a film-maker – Anemone certainly *looks* serious, the correct scowls and swirling skies and wordless, eerie montages to suggest weighty themes, big emotions and ominous suspense. The tools to back up that style with emotional punches that land like the real ones of the brothers – best believe they tussle it out, because of course – are not yet refined, but in this father-son duo, at least, I have faith.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-1236530758/):

>There are flashes of talent in “Anemone.” Ronan Day-Lewis, who has come up in the world as a visual artist, knows how to frame a shot, and he’s canny about playing off the mystique of his father. The whole plot, with Jem entreating Ray to come out of his self-imposed exile, is almost a sly metaphor for how Daniel Day-Lewis would take a sabbatical from acting to become a cobbler or cabinet maker, or for his retirement now. Yet for most of its 125-minute running time, “Anemone” just sits there.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/09/anemone-review-daniel-day-lewis-ronan-day-lewis-sean-bean-1236557832/):

>*Anemone*, is a film that doesn’t live in or anything’s or anyone’s shadow, even though that’s what the story is essentially about, a plot point made all the more salient by the casting — or perhaps that should be *positioning* — of acting giant Day-Lewis Sr. in his first starring role since *Phantom Thread* (yep, another PTA production). Press-wise, the fervor for this long-anticipated return has already done a lot of heavy lifting, especially for savvy arthouse audiences. But, although he could so easily have rested on his old man’s laurels, Day-Lewis Jr. instead exploits those *expectations* of his father’s power (more of that later), and he does so in a fuss-free way that serves the story surprisingly well, right up until the actor finally coughs up his elusive character’s shocking backstory.

[Indiewire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/anemone-review-ronan-day-lewis-1235153177/) (B):

>This is a dense, unforgiving movie in the classic sense, an adults-only drama that doesn’t placate despite its stylistic overreaches. It’s disappointing that in its final moments, the movie has come so far off its own hinges, so deconstructed its own rivets, that it can’t put them back together again. But everything that’s come before is so rich that you’re ready to forgive it. The title, by the way, comes from the flowers that bloomed from Ray’s own father’s planting. Ronan Day-Lewis seems to have plucked and pruned the best lessons from them, too.

**Director's Statement:**

>When I first came on to direct ""Bone Lake"", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a ""popcorn movie"", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, ""Bone Lake"" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate – to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, ""Bone Lake"" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.

The “It” and “Ghostbusters” leading man is teaming with his father, Eric Wolfhard, and producer Rich Peete to bring Bob Mehr’s acclaimed biography “Trouble Boys: The True Story of the Replacements” to the big screen.

The father and son will co-write the screenplay, with Peete producing “Trouble Boys” under his Neighborhood Watch banner. Peete recently collaborated with the CAA-repped Finn Wolfhard on A24’s “The Legend of Ochi,” which made its world premiere at Sundance earlier this year.

Published in 2016, “Trouble Boys” is widely regarded as the definitive chronicle of The Replacements, the legendary Minneapolis punk band known for shaping American alternative rock. While the band’s influence was undeniable, having paved the way for ’90s stadium-fillers Nirvana and Green Day, original members Paul Westerberg, Bob Stinson, Tommy Stinson and Chris Mars often were are at the center of drama. Lorne Michaels banned them from ever returning to “Saturday Night Live” following a self-sabotaging profanity-laced performance in 1986 that signaled the band’s coming downfall. (Westerberg did return to “SNL” as a solo artist in 1993.)

Written by Bob Mehr, a veteran music critic and Grammy-winning essayist, “Trouble Boys” became a New York Times bestseller and earned book-of-the-year honors from NPR and Rolling Stone.

The project marks another move behind the camera for Finn Wolfhard, who recently co-directed, co-wrote and co-produced the Neon horror film “Hell of a Summer” alongside Billy Bryk. At the same time, he has made serious inroads in the music space and is currently on his first solo tour tied to his debut album “Happy Birthday.” The fifth and final season of “Stranger Things” launches on Netflix on Nov. 26 and will roll out incrementally rather than binge-style, wrapping up on New Year’s Eve. 

In a recent Variety cover story, the multi-hyphenate talked about working with his father on a secret music-themed project at their home in Vancouver. “I’ve been writing a lot of music and writing this movie with my dad, which has been really amazing,” Wolfhard said of how he had spent his time since production wrapped on “Stranger Things” in December. “It’s about a band that I think weirdly I have a lot in common with, a lot of the members. I can’t really talk about the actual band because I don’t have the rights officially yet.”

Some Reviews:

[Empire - Sophie Butcher](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/roofman/) \- 4 / 5

>Derek Cianfrance delivers a hugely empathetic, very entertaining depiction of an extraordinary life, featuring one of Channing Tatum’s best performances. Expect laughs, tears, and noughties nostalgia.

[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/roofman-review-channing-tatum-1236510112/)

>In the end, it’s the through-the-roof chemistry between the two leads that makes the film worthy of repeat viewing. Tatum is no longer the cocky teenager he was in the “Step Up” movies all those years ago, as the star’s affected swagger has eased into a natural confidence, while Dunst brings just the right amount of wariness to a woman who’s devoted to her kids and devout in her faith. While she plays Leigh as closed off to love, leave it to Tatum to find that unconventional point of entry.

Jurassic Park is my favorite movie ever and I think the Lost World is a worthy sequel.  But I don’t think any other film in the franchise is higher then a 5/10.

>What follows is a truly bonkers, balls-to-the-wall, hilarious sci-fi adventure that starts out as ""Repo Man"" and ends up going full ""Akira."" It's bold, it's got a great cast, it's one of the timeliest genre movies in years. It is great to have Gore Verbinski back.

[IGN - Matt Donato](https://www.ign.com/articles/good-luck-have-fun-dont-die-review-sam-rockwell-haley-lu-richardson) \- 8 / 10

>At its best, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die is a laugh-filled yet incredibly dark and poignant fever dream that pleads for a safer AI tomorrow. Verbinski's command over utter chaos is nothing short of marvelous, even if the pacing slows while jumping between storylines that eventually all fit together. There's a hopefulness that tries to prevent the film from feeling fatalistic, like there's nothing we can do about AI at its most harmful. But it's also quite entertaining, as Rockwell leads his ragtag squad into escalating unknowns that he actually knows after so many failed missions. As offbeat and dreamlike as Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die becomes, ballooning in scale as time ticks down, its timeliness and prescience are still its most impressive factors. A film this wacky shouldn't be this straightforward, and yet here we are, cleaning the glitter off our bodies; you'll understand soon enough.

>Ultimately, much of the film rides on the back of Sam Rockwell, who is giving one of the most unhinged, fun performances of his career. In the years since his Oscar win for *Three Billboards*, he’s been taking on more “serious” work, and while he’s great at that too, it’s nice to see him return to his zanier *Confessions of a Dangerous Mind* and Justin Hammer side. He is incredibly charming and thrives in this comedic space, and his lead performance makes the over-two-hour runtime ",movies,67,23,2,42,0,0,0.92

September is coming to an end with three newcomers, and neither had a particularly impressive start.

Warner Bros.'s ***One Battle After Another*** topped the box office, but its numbers are a far cry from its profitability prospects. DreamWorks' ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** also had a soft debut, followed by an even worse performance overseas. But the week's worst performer was ***The Strangers – Chapter 2***, which fizzled out from the original film.

The Top 10 earned a combined $67.3 million this weekend. That's down 20.1% from last year, when ***The Wild Robot*** topped the box office and ***Megalopolis*** massively flopped.

Debuting at #1, WB's ***One Battle After Another*** opened with $22 million in 3,634 theaters. And so, after 7 films, WB's streak of films debuting with $40+ million has come to an end. This debut is slightly below Leonardo DiCaprio's previous film ***Killers of the Flower Moon*** ($23.2 million). This was also Paul Thomas Anderson's first film to hit #1 and was his biggest debut, although that's not a high bar; none of his films started on wide release, none played at more than 2,000 theaters, and none earned more than $5 million on a weekend. 

On its own, this would be a respectable figure. But there's one big problem: the film is carrying a gigantic $130 million budget. And so it goes from respectable to ""quite bad"". These numbers are eerily similar to the performance of ***Mickey 17*** earlier this year; it debuted with just $19 million on a $118 million budget before fizzling out quickly. One could argue that the film was made solely for acclaim or awards, but it's still a $130 million blockbuster with an extensive marketing campaign and a huge emphasis on IMAX. So its performance must be judged as a blockbuster.

So how could the film open this low? It's got a fantastic filmmaker teaming up with one of the most popular actors today, and the reviews are fucking fantastic (96% on RT, 95 on Metacritic). Wouldn't that translate into at least $30 million?

For starters, and this is something that it's a very sad truth, Paul Thomas Anderson is a stranger to the public. He's got the acclaim and awards, but his films have not connected with the public. His highest grossing film is ***There Will Be Blood*** with $40 million domestically. The rest of his films haven't cracked $30 million, and his last three films didn't even hit $25 million. With the exception of ***There Will Be Blood*** and ***Boogie Nights***, all of his films have flopped at the box office. And that's a huge shame, for he has delivered so much high quality for the decades. But audiences only recognize a few directors, and sadly, Anderson is not one of those directors.

Leonardo DiCaprio is definitely a box office draw. Otherwise, the film wouldn't have opened to $20 million (and it's quite similar to ***Killers of the Flower Moon*** last year). But it's strange that this film opened below that film, considering it had a ""shorter"" runtime, more action and proper actor promotion (***Killers*** debuted during the SAG strike). While DiCaprio can attract audiences to theaters, seems like there's only so much he can do for a film like this.

The ""no marketing"" excuse can't be thrown here. WB mounted a very extensive marketing campaign, to the point that they even had a Fornite collaboration. It simply seems that the audience just wasn't interested in what the film had to offer, or the interest was smaller than expected. The first trailer also struggled to properly sell the film, focusing solely on DiCaprio and the cast going on crazy shenanigans. The second trailer properly sold the film's premise on a clearer angle, but it feels like the audience didn't want to give it a chance. With current tensions (both inside and outside America), it seems like audiences weren't in the mood for a story about revolutionaries.

According to Warner Bros., 62% of the audience was male, and a colossal 77% was 25 and over. Those demographics are a bit concerning; it means young audiences didn't give a chance to the film, and that DiCaprio's presence failed to attract women to the film. 45% of the audience primarily watched the film for Anderson, and 41% for DiCaprio.

As an interesting stat, Deadline just reported that 72% of the film's performance came from blue counties. It overperformed in theaters located in blue counties by 13%, and underperformed in red counties by 24%. 51% of the film's attendance were in areas with populations north of 1 million. Compared to non-horror R-rated films, it over-performed in New York City (22% over the norm), San Francisco (+21%), Washington, DC (+26%) and Toronto (+61%). Two underperforming cities were Houston (-30%) and Dallas (-23%).

Now, not everything is lost. Audiences gave the film a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, which is the best of Anderson's career and the greatest score for DiCaprio since ***Titanic***. The film's older demographic also indicates that those don't neccessarily rush out to watch a film as soon as possible. With strong word of mouth and awards buzz, perhaps the film could leg out through October. It should definitely cross $70 million domestically. But is that going to be enough for this film? Look at the overseas section.

In second place, Universal/DreamWorks' ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie*** debuted with $13.6 million in 3,500 theaters. That's DreamWorks' seventh lowest debut ever, and it goes all the way to top 5 worst if we adjust inflation.

Considering the film's tepid $32 million budget, this is not really a bad way to start. But it truly shows that a show's popularity doesn't always translate to a great result in the box office. Getting audiences invested in a ***Gabby's Dollhouse*** film was always going to be a challenge; it's a pre-scholar show with basically nothing for adults. Kids are obviously the main target, but adults are the ones who pay tickets and so it came a dilemma: will adults pay to watch something that their kids can watch at home in Netflix?

According to Universal, 72% of the audience was female, and obviously the main demo was young girls. They gave it a rare ""A+"" on CinemaScore, which is actually DreamWorks' first ever film to get that grade (crazy, right?). The film's advantage is that there's not much family competition through October, so it could leg out. For now, it should hit around $45 million domestically.

Dropping to third place after topping the box office for two weeks, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** continued its collapse. This time, it dropped 59%, adding $7.1 million this weekend. The film has amassed $118.1 million so far, and it should finish with around $130 million.

***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** dropped 45%, adding $6.7 million. The film's domestic total stands at $161.3 million, and it looks like it will struggle to hit $180 million domestically.

In fifth place, Lionsgate's ***The Strangers – Chapter 2*** mustered just $5.8 million in 2,690 theaters. That's down a very rough 51% from ***Chapter 1*** ($11.8 million), which debuted back in May 2024.

There was no way this film was gonna come close to ***Chapter 1***. Not only because they waited 17 months to release the sequel, which was already complete back then, but because the film also earned very poor reviews, signaling that there was very little interest in a follow-up. And if you were expecting the film to be an improvement, well, that's not really the case (16% on RT).

According to Lionsgate, 51% of the audience was female and 73% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a brutal ""C–"" on CinemaScore, which is the lowest in the franchise. Given the horror competition on its way, it would be a surprise if ***Chapter 2*** made it past $15 million domestically. And there's still a ***Chapter 3*** waiting to be released, so we'll see how low the floor can get.

Universal's ***Him*** fumbled hard on its second weekend. The film collapsed a horrible 73%, earning just $3.5 million this weekend. The drop is not a surprise, considering the film's very poor word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $20.7 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $30 million domestically.

***The Long Walk*** keeps on walking with some good drops. Once again, it dropped just 47% and added $3.3 million this weekend. The film has earned $28.7 million, and it should get to over $35 million by the end of its run.

In eighth place, ***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** earned $3.3 million, for a 48% drop. The film has made $38.9 million, and it should finish with around $47 million domestically.

Fathom Events re-released Sam Raimi's ***Spider-Man*** trilogy, and they made $2.25 million this weekend combined.

Rounding out the Top 10 was the Indian film ***They Call Him OG***, which made $1.4 million ($5.2 million four-day).

After its horrible start last week, Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** pretty much died this week. It earned just $1.1 million, which was a very poor 66% second weekend drop. Romance films never drop that high. With just $5.7 million in 10 days, the film is going to lose so many screens. It won't make it much further than $7 million domestically.

Vertical released ***Dead of Winter*** in 605 theaters, but it could only make $1 million. It won't last long in theaters.

Sony also released Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut ***Eleanor the Great*** in 892 theaters, but it was a misfire with just $865,000 this weekend. Ouch.

***One Battle After Another*** debuted with $26 million overseas, for a $48 million worldwide debut. That's just a little bit better than the worldwide debut of ***Killers of the Flower Moon*** ($21 million overseas, $44 million worldwide). Anderson's biggest debut, but like the domestic market, not a high bar; none of his film has made more than $80 million worldwide. The best debuts were in the UK ($3.4M), France ($3.4M), Germany ($2M), Italy ($1.4M) and Saudi Arabia ($1.3M). Markets like South Korea, Japan, Turkey and China are left.

The one way to describe these numbers is ""incredibly soft"", but it's also close to ""bad."" DiCaprio's films are known for legging out, but it's still a huge barrier for the film to reach the $300 million it needs to break even. We'll keep an eye on this one. At the very least, this film should win tons of awards. And with this film, WB has officially crossed $4 billion, becoming the first studio this year to achieve it.

***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** added $19.2 million. As such, the film has crossed $600 million worldwide, the first anime title to do so. The best Crunchyroll/Sony markets are Mexico ($16.6M), Germany ($12.5M), France ($12.3M), India ($9M) and the UK ($8.4M).

***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** added $15.6 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $436 million. The best markets are Mexico ($28.5M), the UK ($22.1M), France ($18M), Brazil ($16.4M) and Germany ($14.4M). 

In Asia, ***Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc*** added $7 million, for a $26 million overseas run. It will release in other markets through October.

***Gabby's Dollhouse*** opened with a soft $5.5 million overseas, for a so-so $19.2 million worldwide debut. While it still has many markets left, that's not an encouraging sign for its prospects.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Jurassic World: Rebirth* | Jul/2 | Universal | $92,016,065 | $339,640,400 | $867,114,682 | $180M

- Universal's ***Jurassic World Rebirth*** has closed its run with $339 million domestically and $867 million worldwide. Another big success in this dino trilogy, despite the very mediocre reception it has garnered. Universal did everything on its power to make sure the film got finished quickly and released here because reasons. And it paid off profit-wise. Although it didn't really change the fact that the franchise has continued its decline at the box office; going $1.6B > $1.3B > $1.0B > $867M suggests that maybe you should work on improving the writing, you know?

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We're getting three wide releases and a limited release.

The biggest release is actually not a film. It's ***Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl***, a special program for the release of Swift's new album, ***The Life of a Showgirl***. She already had a lot of power with ***The Eras Tour*** making over $260 million, and while this won't perform like that, it will still post some strong numbers. It was reported that the film has already sold $15 million in pre-sales in its first 24 hours across all circuits. But this event will only last one weekend.

There's also A24's ***The Smashing Machine***, the new film from Benny Safdie. It stars Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, following the life of former amateur wrestler and MMA fighter Mark Kerr. The film is sold pretty much on ""The Rock is acting"" and has been a point of praise in all the film's reviews so far. Reviews for the film are positive (but not exactly highly acclaimed), and maybe the audience will respond favorably to the film.

IFC and Shudder are also releasing horror film ***Good Boy***, which tells the story of a haunted house from the perspective of a dog. The companies seem confident in the film, considering they chose to open it in wide release instead of starting slow. The budget is insanely low, so the chances of breaking out are on its favor.

And in limited release, there's Focus Features' ***Anemone***. The film has one selling point: the return of the GOAT Daniel Day-Lewis after a 8-year absence, who co-wrote the film with his son Ronan (the director). Everyone knows he always delivers, and this is not going to be the exception. The film itself, however, won't. It's currently sitting at a middling 60% on RT and 48% on Metacritic, which is very poor for a platform release. With other adult dramas this month, it's likely that it will get lost once it expands wide next week.

But still, I'd take a 3 hour and 20 minute actual adaptation of the book, and it's anti war message about greed and how what can sound like a grand adventure at the start can turn out to be sad. Give me the remake, not a damned Gollum movie!

Some Reviews:

[Collider - Nate Richard](https://collider.com/play-dirty-review-mark-wahlberg-lakeith-stanfield-shane-black/) \- 7 / 10

>If you watch *Play Dirty* expecting something on the level of *The Nice Guys* or *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang*, you will be disappointed. However, the latest action-comedy from Black proves that he's still capable of delivering an equal parts funny and action-heavy comedy with all the trademarks that make us love him as a filmmaker. It's a straight-to-streaming movie starring Mark Wahlberg, and considering some of the movie star's other recent films, such as *The Family Plan* and *The Union*, *Play Dirty* is far better than you'd expect it to be.

>More to the point, it’s a “Parker” reboot with an eye toward franchise potential, which is something about it that would’ve made Westlake happy (he only allowed productions to use that name if they agreed to produce a whole series of films based on his books). And while this isn’t *quite* the stuff of vintage Black, it’s close enough that I wouldn’t mind seeing him crank another one out every two years for the next decade.

>You can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, but you have to know how to crack them, or you could end up with a bowl full of shells. And you have to know how to cook them, or else they lose their texture. “Play Dirty” makes for a decent omelette, but the recipe is a little off, and that’s annoying because we’re hungry for a great Parker movie. We’ve had a lot of adaptations, actually, but only a few did the job right (John Boorman’s “Point Blank” remains the gold standard). But if you’re starving for caper flicks, “Play Dirty” is just hard-boiled enough to satisfy.

In this version they reintroduced approximately 11 minutes of footage deleted in the 1973 version. The most famous additions are:

The infamous ""spider walk"" scene (Regan descending the stairs on all fours and backwards).

A conversation between the priests Merrin and Karras.

An extended ending that includes a meeting between Lieutenant Kinderman and Father Dyer.

My fancy for this film is mainly the Chicago setting.  Always loved that city.  There's also the deadpan-somewhat-stoic, ""suffer in silence because I'm Soviet""  attitude portrayed  by Arnold Schwarzenegger that softens by the end of the movie vs. Belushi's loud American persona that warms up to his USSR counterpart.  

Anyone else have some love for this movie?

The scene with an injured Sean Penn confronting Christopher Walken at his home is a master class in acting from Walken. Fear, bravado, nuance, resignation all in one scene. Brilliant.

And the score by Patrick Leonard is iconic. Synth 80s moody. Loved it. Patrick Leonard tells the story of how Warner fought Madonna hard on releasing Live to Tell  first, or at all. As he said, there was nothing like it on radio, and it was a long song, with stops in the middle. Her voice was very low, and it was a huge departure for her. Madonna said if they didn’t release it first she wouldn’t do any videos for True Blue  singles. Pat said the execs at Warner were beyond angry at this power move and felt the song would flop hard. Madonna said it would be a hit. This cemented her control over her career.

Taking the best song of the musical, THE MUSIC AND THE MIRRORS, and having it substituted with an original song which sounded like it was already questionable besides casting a actress who can't sing (Alyson Reed is a terrific dancer however her singing sounded like a Parrot's shriek), changing the meaning of WHAT I DID FOR LOVE, adding forgettable original songs. Aside from Vicki Frederick and the outstanding choreography, A CHORUS LINE deserves a 2nd stab at a proper film adaptation. Besides, in a musical about dancers, you never see Audrey Landers actually dance. And in at least one group number, she disappears completely. They were too cheap to hire a body double.

The Film's Story:

The film tells the story of Sophie, a woman reflecting on a holiday she spent in Turkey with her young father, Calum, twenty years ago. At the time, she was unaware of his struggle with depression. The journey reveals his inner sadness and conflicts, which she only came to understand as an adult. The film explores Sophie's memories, a blend of truth and imagination, as she tries to understand the father who was an enigma to her and reconcile with his past to better know herself.

**My First Viewing:**

I first saw this film before I left my family and moved away due to circumstances in my life, around the end of 2022, just after it premiered at festivals and on streaming platforms. Back then, I didn't find it particularly special. I watched it online, gave it three stars, and that was that.

**My Second Viewing & Personal Reflection:**

Later, when I started living alone, I began to rethink my relationship with my parents. I started seeing them as human beings separate from me—not just as ""Mom and Dad,"" but as people who were living life for the first time, just like me. They had their own stories, lives, and experiences that shaped them long before I existed. This perspective made me overlook some of the problems from my childhood. I even realized that when we texted on the phone, we expressed our feelings more freely because of the distance, unlike when I lived with them.

This reminded me of a saying: ""Our parents haven't lived seven thousand years; this is their first time living life, just like us."" It's possible they faced situations they didn't know how to handle and made mistakes with us. All of this thinking brought me back to *Aftersun*, and I found myself deeply relating to it this time.

My second viewing was in a cinema. Even though I had already seen it, I felt a need to watch it surrounded by people. The theater was packed because the film had gained fame for impressing the critics.

**Understanding the Film's Core:**

And then I truly grasped the film's story: Sophie, whose father committed suicide after their last vacation together. She was angry at him for it. As a child, she didn't understand the reasons; to her, he was just normal. She thought his yoga was just ""weird moves."" There was a distance between them, visually represented by the camera in some scenes. She couldn't remember everything perfectly, so she had to fill those gaps in her memory, aided by the camcorder footage from their holiday.

**What I Loved About the Film:**

What I appreciated most was that the film never directly stated the reason for Calum's suicide. Instead, we discover it alongside Sophie. We see scenes of him crying, hints of his financial struggles, his separation from his wife, and his own suffering with his father during his childhood. This background made him strive to provide everything he could for Sophie, despite his poverty, so she wouldn't feel the lack he felt as a child—something Sophie herself notices and mentions to him in one poignant scene. The scene where he breaks down after Sophie celebrates his birthday, which clearly triggered childhood trauma, was especially powerful.

The film speaks to the gap between children and parents. A child sees a parent as someone who is supposed to provide for them, often failing to see them as a human being with a full life, burdens, and a personality that was formed long before they became a parent. Sophie tries to see Calum as the person she didn't understand when she was young, the person she was angry at for leaving her. She re-evaluates him through the lens of her own adulthood and experience as a mother.


The film ended, and I spontaneously started clapping. Soon, the entire theater joined me.

Norma gets a bad rep for what she does but I think Joe Gillis is the bad guy.

I mean these are hands down some of the most powerful demons we got in horror - rivaled imo, only by the Cenobytes. 

The are practically indestructible outside of total bodily dismemberment (and even then that wont stop some of them). They can spread like wildfire depending on the type of Deadite (Blood in the modern movies, insanity and mental weaknesses in the original). They can twist and bend their host bodies in ways that should not be possible. Are very strong - physically and psychically... 

But what makes them so great is the fact that unlike any other demon in cinema - Deadites have a sick sense of humor! They get off on the psychological torture of not only their victims but their host body as well. They find injury hilarious and will go to extreme lengths to intensify any wounds they sustain. 

They love verbally berating their victims, using memories and voice queues to mess with them. They will use any and all tools and weapons at thwir disposal to kill their prey although a lot of the time they content themselves with just beating on people for their own amusement instead of outright murdering them instantly. 

And on top of that, they are the Theater Kids of the demon world. They don't HAVE to rhyme or sing or dance but they do for their own amusement...

They dont have to eat shards of glass or peel their faces off or eat chunks of hair or use their fingers and mouth to play records but they do becausr they are extra. They are drama queens who loce making everything about themselves. 

Damn it I love Deadites!!

This movie is great and only is really scarier as I appreciate it more, if that even makes sense. It's because given Freddy has only about seven minutes of screen time in the entire movie, that's only beneficial because you can still feel his presence even when he's not actually there in the moment, but the impact he puts on everything as it all progresses. 

It's definitely a less is more type situation. And it seems like how of the slasher elites like Ghostface, Chucky, Michael, Jason, Leatherface, and the new addition Art the Clown, although maybe he's the closest to Freddy.......Freddy is the most powerful because he obviously comes after you when you doze off...

I made a website that shows 30k+ movie theaters (cinemas) around the world on a single map, taking data from different showtime listings and movie theater websites. I tried getting as many theaters as possible. I didn't get all but I think I got most.

Some things I found: 

- Many movie theaters, especially in developing countries, are inside malls. Malls might be dying in America but they are loving them abroad. 

- I found the most theaters for China, more than any other country in the world. Over 12k at this point. 

- Lots of theaters in remote areas, including islands or really northern parts of Scandinavia or Russia.

Some people may compare this to CinemaTreasures and I love CinemaTreasures and have been a contributor there for years. It's maybe my favorite website. But their strong suite is historic and domestic (U.S.) theaters. For example, for China they have fewer than 200 theaters right now and it is an arduous process to add individual locations there. Even GoogleMaps is missing many China locations (and for the U.S. it often gives places that are not movie theaters when you search movie theaters). So I hope this can be like a companion, more of a way to just see all theaters on a map.  The goal is also that this can help someone find a movie theater no matter where they are in the world. 

There are ways to search for locations, filter by country or draw custom borders to see all the theaters there.

I am still missing some locations and there may be duplicates or wrong coordinates on the map. If you find any errors or missing theaters, please let me know. I know for a fact I am missing theaters, particularly in India and North Africa so I would be grateful if people could identify them.
