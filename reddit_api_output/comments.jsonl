Most mainstream films now have subtext and themes literally spoken by characters as dialogue because the suits are worried people have their heads in their phones. This film doesn‚Äôt. It is well rounded characters navigating a reality to achieve their goals. It reminded me a lot of No Country For Old Men in that yes it‚Äôs cops and robbers, but it‚Äôs got way much more going on behind it. Back then I remember the ending of that film capturing a lot of imagination in the public about expectations of film endings but I don‚Äôt see a similar conversation being there for this film nowadays.

For me, It felt like a lot was missing, story and character-wise but the animation and music was pretty sweet. I don't think it's a bad movie and I also respect that art resonates with people in all sorts of different ways.\n\nMy issue with a lot of the praise that this movie receives is that people describe this movie as objectively great media while also defending it's shortcomings with \"it's a kids movie\" or \"the music and art was great so it's okay that the story is a bit weaker\" or my least favourite one, \"there's a directors cut that makes the movie great so it's chill\". There are definitely great parts of this movie but weak points of any form of media shouldn't be defended by qualities that are unrelated to what is being criticized.\n\nCollectively, we've become too forgiving of shortcomings and it feels (I know this is pretty dramatic) dangerous. When we celebrate decent as great, it disincentivizes greatness altogether and the behaviour that I've described drives the bar for media further and further down. We deserve greatness and sometimes we have to settle for less because greatness is a hard thing to achieve, but we shouldn't redefine it just because it's rare.\n\nIt's okay to love something that's not great but it's equally as important to be acknowledge that. Greatness is subjective but if you have valid criticisms that would usually move the needle, then that should say enough. But if you genuinely thought the movie was great altogether, all the power to you!\n\nFor me, it didn't compare to the kids movies I considered and still consider great.

And it has some filler that works when it's split into two parts, but just gets tedious in a single long movie.\n\nA few years ago, I watched a video by the Angry Video Game Nerd where he proposed an edit of the two movies into a single 2-hour movie, and he had many good ideas, but his editing seemed way too aggressive to me, as I enjoy the way Tarantino lets some of his scenes \"breathe\".  But AVGN's ideas to resequence the movie for better pacing seemed sound to me.  The following is copy-pasted from a comment I made a while back that describes what I did:\n\nI made my own fanedit based on his proposed sequence, but without all the small cuts into scenes. I took out a few things that were kind of superfluous, but the scenes I kept I mostly kept unedited, apart from what I absolutely needed to cut to allow things to flow to the next scene. But the main thing was changing the sequence of events to get a movie with much better pacing and build-up (and this is more or less what the AVGN guy was suggesting with his edit, so he should get the credit)\n\nSPOILER WARNING: if you haven't already seen both movies stop reading NOW!\n\n- Start with the wedding rehearsal scene, Bill showing up, and finally the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad arriving\n- Opening credits (merging the vol.1 and vol.2 credits) ending with us seeing the Bride lying on the floor\n- the sheriff and his son at the church\n- the bride at the hospital in a coma, giving us a chance to flash back to Bill telling the story of Pai Mei\n- back to the Bride in a coma getting a visit from Elle\n- another flashback to her going to Pai Mei to train. On her last punch on the big wooden beam, she wakes with a start from her coma (rape scene cut for time and pacing)\n- Getting out of the hospital, and Tarantino's foot fetish scene in the Pussy Wagon (unfortunately, without the rape scene, we lose the explanation for why she takes the Pussy Wagon...  That's hard to fix, and would require cutting some scenes that I still feel are important)\n- From there, straight to Okinawa to get the sword\n- Then we get O-Ren's story (including the animated part) This serves to establish O-Ren's importance (more on that later) ending after she kills her \"dissenter\"\n- Bill visits Bud, and they talk about B getting a Hanzo sword\n- Then B visits Copperhead and kills her in front of her daughter\n- B then goes to Bud's place, where he buries her alive. The point at which she's buried alive is almost precisely at the mid-point of this edit, which works really well for pacing.\n- We then get the scene from the following morning when Elle visits Bud and kills him with a Black Mamba\n- We then go back slightly to watch B get out of her coffin, and walk back to Bud's place with the Sun creeping back up into the sky, so that when we cut back to Elle coming out of Bud's trailer, B is there.\n- The Elle vs. B fight. When B slams the trailer's door behind her at the end of this scene, cut straight to the club where the Crazy 88 fight happens.\n- We see O-Ren with her crew, and how the hosts are scared of her and her gang, and we see B arriving\n- The whole Crazy 88 fight (if I'd had access to the color version, I would have used it)\n- The fight with O-Ren. Skip the scene outside from the end of Vol.1 with Sofie Fatale because we cut straight to--\n- The drive over to Bill's place (also skip the scene where B finds out where Bill is... it's easy to assume she would know already)\n- The whole sequence at Bill's plays out normally, as does the ending of the movie.\n\nThere's more to my edit than that, but the point is, this sequence is better because: - it keeps the big fight setpiece for near the end, kind of like how video games will often have the penultimate boss fight be more challenging than the actual final boss fight (many of the Metroid games feature a more challenging Ridley fight than the final boss fight of the game!) which is why it was important to build up O-Ren earlier in the movie!\n\nB's nadir happens at almost precisely the mid-point, when she's buried alive.\nThe \"boss fights\" keep building up in challenge: Copperhead -> Bud (debatable, since there's no real fight) -> Elle -> O-Ren\nThe pacing doesn't drop to a crawl in the second half with all the flashbacks and exposition happening earlier on (but still interspersed with action so you don't get too tired of all the exposition)\nIt does ruin the surprise as to who B is early on, but that only made sense when these were two movies separated by a year's wait.\n\nAnd the long scenes that were cut were the least important, and actually felt like padding so both movies could be about 2h long each. As it stands, my edit lasts about 3h10, ignoring the end credits (I basically appended the vol.1 end credits at the end of the vol.2 end credits, which makes for about 20 minutes of end credits. A more ambitious editor might have completely redone the end titles to remove all the redundancies, but I enjoyed all the varying fonts and presentation of these credit sequences, so I kept them in (as well as the outtake with B gouging the eye out.)\n\nAnyway, apart from a few small details I couldn't fix because I could only work from the two movies I had, I like the result enough that this is the version I've been watching and rewatching for the past few years.", "vader_compound": -0.8927, "sentiment_label": "neg", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nw5xbt", "comment_id": "nhfyo2n", "author": "u/thundercrunt", "created": "2025-10-02T22:08:43+00:00", "score": 2, "body": "Not even his sixth best movie in my book.", "vader_compound": 0.6369, "sentiment_label": "pos", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nw5xbt", "comment_id": "nhdtjoi", "author": "u/chadwicke619", "created": "2025-10-02T15:51:14+00:00", "score": 3, "body": "Maybe this is a hot take from me, but I think calling Kill Bill his best work is wild.", "vader_compound": -0.1901, "sentiment_label": "neu", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nw5xbt", "comment_id": "nhdtuip", "author": "u/contude327", "created": "2025-10-02T15:52:41+00:00", "score": 3, "body": "Best?

Also not just for the moment he's watching the videos back but this moment right at the start.\n\nYou can feel both he and Hathaway absolutely crushed as the realization sets in. They don't sell it with some big ridiculous freakout but with that quick stomach drop and 1000 yard stare right as TARS reads out 23 years. And the sting is driven further by Zimmer's score. A long, slow decrescendo immediately answered by a dissonant higher note slowly stabbing in like a knife and following McConaughey out. Been a while since my band days so forgive any incorrect terms.\n\nAnyway, that absolute menace slowly plays with your emotions bringing some major elements back into the score slowly, building back to one of the main theme's leitmotifs as McConaughey sits down trying to steady himself for what he's about to watch. The score keeps building back up across relentlessly long shots of McConaughey rapidly breaking down as all 23 of those years are pumped into his brain. The chord progression is careful to never get TOO hopeful but also never too down. Meant to reflect life's ups and downs but compressed into one single strand.\n\nTo be slightly more specific, assuming this is in 3/4, the quarter notes are constantly progressing upwards yet still bouncing back down first before jumping up. The sustained note below them provides a somber baseline that is almost ominous by contrast. And it keeps strumming along as if it's all working towards some agreement.\n\nBut nah, not with ol Zims at the podium. Instead he just fuckin yanks the carpet out from under you literally mid-note. Doesn't even wait for a solid beat.\n\nYou're holding onto an emotional cliff while his son is possibly saying his last goodbyes and this man comes along and plucks you right off as the score completely cuts out to leaving you sitting awkwardly in silence with McConaughey and his creaky chair desperate to see more...just to have his now adult daughter glow and shift into frame from the darkened screen (with another slow high-pitches stab by the score). Actually absolute cinema.\n\nSome additional S-tier shit again from Nolan specifically here too: The light fading in and out on McConaughey's face drops out once more for a longer period as he waits. But sneaks back in to help that \"Hey dad!\" burn just a smidge more. Also such a small choice with the type of display/video being used and it's hard to describe why it works but trust me if this was just like standard well-lit full color clear footage it wouldn't have had the same impact. That tiny moment right at 4:09 where \"Murph\" pops on screen slightly obscured is goddamn \\*chef's kiss\\*. Very very slightly delaying the revelation even to the audience just makes that hit even harder.\n\nSo yeah, big fan of this movie.\n\nETA - Regarding the ending (I'ma make this real small **do not read if you haven't seen this movie**, you've already spoiled enough for yourself):\n\n^(People have a whole lot to say about how the film wrapped up. it's possibly the most common criticism. That and Nolan's lust for hamfisted exposition usualy rattled off by characters walking around in two different)\n\n^(locations at two different times carrying on the same sentence, but I digress. I didn't have too much of a problem with it.)\n\n^(I'm not religious. I don't even consider myself particularly spiritual these days. I was raised Catholic and used to still believe in something so maybe part of me still wants to, but that's another subreddit. Even as a cold stoic I appreciated the way the film crosses over the boundary of what we think we understand so far firmly into some truly wild shit.)\n\n^(And that's just it, really. We have no idea beyond that point. Hell, we barely even know what a black hole is or does to our reality. So fuck it, sure. He gets warped into a tesseract where the) *^(Power of Love)* ^(or cyclical/circular nature of reality, whatever, basically navigates him back to his daughter to somehow etch a binary message into watch hands ticking along through all time. Why the fuck not?)\n\n^(Or hey, maybe he died and this was all his brain giving him one final show before lights out. Thankfully Nolan didn't leave any spinning tops for us to analyze this time so you can just make that the ending yourself if you want.)", "vader_compound": -0.9496, "sentiment_label": "neg", "agrees": 1, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1ntlr51", "comment_id": "ngun5h6", "author": "u/joeyjusticeco", "created": "2025-09-29T16:21:08+00:00", "score": 11, "body": "Greatest movie of all time", "vader_compound": 0.6369, "sentiment_label": "pos", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1ntlr51", "comment_id": "ngv50f7", "author": "u/philipkdan", "created": "2025-09-29T17:45:58+00:00", "score": 3, "body": "Saw this film in the theaters 3 times during its initial run.

Your average blue-collar joe watching a sitcom or movie isn't going to care that Neil Patrick Harris isn't actually banging women IRL. This is a fact.\n\n> Even in the Kate Winslet article I mentioned above, she acknowledges a queer role she had been recently cast in that didn‚Äôt bother auditioning other actors for the part.\n\nBecause there's such a thing as marketing and the power of names. Audiences are more likely to see a Kate Winslet rom-com than a rom-com starring a no-name actress even if the premises are identical. Whoever made this movie clearly liked the look or acting style of Kate specifically. \n\nPlus the article seems to add to my point:\n\n> While queer and trans stars like Kristen Stewart and Elliot Page may be the face of a newer, more tolerant Hollywood\n\nMore evidence that there is no discrimination thus no need to protect the roles. LGBT people are literally the face of modern Hollywood. However, the goal posts were then moved to men.\n\n> Winslet‚Äôs intel checks out. Stars like Tom Hardy have seen public blowback after coming out as bi or even admitting to the odd affair with other men. \n\nHer intel doesn't check out, what was the public blowback? 12 mean comments on social media? He's not had to hide his sexuality and it has had zero impact on his career. Buff straight men with shaved heads have either dressed up as one of his characters or considered it at some point in their lives. Zero repercussions.\n\n> coming out as bisexual or gay is seen as a career-killing mistake on the part of old-fashioned executives and casting agents.\n\nThis is conjecture and speculation, the key part is \"seen as\" because the writer is basically saying this is what the vibe feels like, not the true thoughts or policies of anyone in particular. \n\n> Plausible deniability is 100% a thing. My grandma believed that Liberace was straight until the day she died.\n\nI said in another comment that part of me suspects he might be bisexual but I also know that's wishful thinking on my part. \n\n> Sean Hayes from Will and Grace has said he has struggled to find work since the show ended because of type casting and producers believing openly queer actors can‚Äôt convince an audience that they can play a straight role.\n\nIs it really that unheard of that a star of a hit TV sitcom can't find work after? Being typecast by audiences is a thing that isn't really Hollywood's fault. It's kind of like how David Schwimmer will always be perceived as the neurotic dorky Ross. I think it's hard for people to break the association when you've seen that actor in a certain role again and again on a weekly basis on your TV. So in this instance since not only is he now joining the ranks of struggling TV actors, he's also permanently perceived as that character.\n\nI kinda get why it sometimes goes beyond acting. Like if Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke with a soft lisp instead of an Austrian accent and was known as a flamboyantly gay dancer, he probably wouldn't have been cast as Terminator because a lot of audiences would've been like, *\"I don't know if I can see him as a real threat\"* thus not giving the film a chance.

There are endless actors of greater skill who simply, don‚Äôt get called because they aren‚Äôt in the club.  \n      Last Saturday, Sean Penn did a ridiculous interview for the New York Times Daily Podcast where he ranted about hating incompetence in others, while stating that: He hated school and should have been left to spend his days surfing in his youth, escaped justice in china for threatening to throw a reporter off a balcony, and respects Charlie Kirk for believing life begins at conception.  Penn will likely be offered an Oscar for essentially playing himself against Leonardo for doing the same.  \nIs the movie good? Yes.  It was made by disciplined people like most studio movies. There was a lot to like about it.  DiCaprio was fine, but I can‚Äôt see Teyana Taylor with him, let alone loving him.  He just seemed to be chasing the hot girl well out of his league, because they chose to portray him as having nothing to offer anyone.  He wasn‚Äôt even a good father, dedicating his life to self medication.\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler:  Did we need the extra time in a near 3 hour movie to see Penn die twice? It was pretty silly the first time (can you imagine the effect of one handed shooting a shotgun off in a moving car?).  There‚Äôs a reason why people don‚Äôt do this often in real life.  But maybe it was an important part of Penn‚Äôs arc to be able to play possum, only to die quietly a second time in a Bond villain office suite gas‚Äôs chamber?  \n\nClearly you all will disagree, but I found Benicio to have the most interesting character.  As a non actor, I‚Äôll leave the acting community to pick the ‚Äúfinest comic actor‚Äù and doubt it would be DiCaprio.", "vader_compound": 0.9246, "sentiment_label": "pos", "agrees": 1, "disagrees": 1}\n{"post_id": "1nwe6qk", "comment_id": "nhg542t", "author": "u/gunt_lint", "created": "2025-10-02T22:45:01+00:00", "score": -10, "body": "Oh well good thing that talentless hack Paul Thomas Anderson got Leo to do this movie, or otherwise it would have sucked apparently\n\nEdit: Holy hell you rubes do I really have to add the /s on here?", "vader_compound": -0.7351, "sentiment_label": "neg", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nwe6qk", "comment_id": "nhhzl6g", "author": "u/Appropriate_Till8956", "created": "2025-10-03T05:50:56+00:00", "score": -1, "body": "I see this movie has great reviews.

You have to be top of the food chain to do that. We're talking the top 1% of all actors. That's maybe 10-20 people, tops. And it doesn't last forever. John Travolta was the hottest actor in the 70s. Now look at what he's doing. \n\nAny actor can turn down any audition. But what people don't realize is that auditions are sparce to begin with. You don't book auditions based on your talent. You get auditions based on what you look like. Because casting directors are looking for types, not talent. Your gender, race, age, height, and weight are far more important than how talented you are. \n\nauditions become less and less frequent the more famous you get. Once your quote reaches a certain level, your agent will no longer accept any roles that are beneath that. You won't get called for auditions that only pay scale, if your resume far exceeds scale pay. Let's say you were a series regular on a sitcom. Like Wayne Knight (Newman) on Seinfeld. Even though Newman only appeard in like 40 of the 180 episodes of Seinfeld. He's now considered way too famous to be going out for auditions that are only paying scale, aka, the minimum wage for union actors. \n\nAt a certain point, they don't even have auditions if they want someone of a certain fame level. They just start polling random people. If a casting director is looking for a famous black male comedian, they will literally just start surveying people on the street, who do you like better? Chris Rock, Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence, Kevin Hart, etc. And whichever actor receives the most votes, they will be offered that role. So if Chris Rock gets the most votes, they'll offer it to him. And if for whatever reason Rock decides to turn it down, then they'll offer it to the next highest vote getter. But given how scare these roles are, Rock wouod likely take the role. \n\nAnd the amount of roles you can audition for shrinks significantly. Unless you're willing to audition for something below your quote. But when you do that, that now becomes your quote. Because who's gonna pay you above scale, when you've been going out to auditions that pay scale?", "vader_compound": 0.9843, "sentiment_label": "pos", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nw8sum", "comment_id": "nheo7w2", "author": "u/TisBeTheFuk", "created": "2025-10-02T18:18:14+00:00", "score": 26, "body": "Jonathan Rhys Meyers.

But I don't mind the third act. For me it's the decisions depicted earlier in the film, though it's hard to remember for sure what bothered me. I think it was a mix between the decision \n>!to follow the distress signal and the make mistake to not just forget to align the heat shields or whatever it was. I mean I guess I could have lived with the first one, but barely. As I understood the movie, this is not some distant future where humanity is cruising regularly between mining colonies in the solar system. They barely scrape together the technology to bring this bomb to the sun. A change of objectives and course feels more like it should be impossible in this context, especially since one would think the teams who made this mission possible made sure this spacecraft goes to the sun and only to the sun.\n\nAnyway, so they do it this way, fine, but I just cannot accept the whole process of the course correction which basically led to the downfall of this mission. I mean to me as the audience the whole mission and the spaceship itself feels extremely fragile, and no one has ever succeeded in this kind of thing. So then basically some crew member does this incredibly important task completely alone when NO ONE is around and he just .. forgets about an important step?? The whole maneuver should be highly unusual with the available experience of humanity in space faring and they're handling it like an everyday task that Chewbacca does on a Tuesday. So while the whole science fiction idea is great as it feels like the crew has to do Star Trek stuff (change course) with advanced Apollo 13 technology, the way they do it in the first place is just not credible enough for me and that just ruins the rest of the movie as I'm constantly thinking: yeah but that in the beginning was just stupid so I don't really give a shit about anything anymore.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that this could have been easily written in a different way. You make that stupidly dangerous decision to go to Icarus II? Fine, but then the whole crew should have to do overtime and make sure that everything works smoothly. You need something in the ship to break in the process so the stakes get higher? Fine, introduce a 2% chance that the heat shields might not align correctly because the ship is not built for that kind of mission. Furthermore, since the additional explosives that can be gathered on the Icarus 1 improve the success of the whole mission by say 60%, our crew of scientists decided to vote for the maneuver, which is not entirely credible but also not entirely stupid. And they make the experience, that 2% is still too much and everything from there on can be exactly like in the original plot including a crew member that feels guilty and so on.!<\n\nBtw: maybe I didn't remember everything correctly so feel free to correct me.", "vader_compound": 0.9413, "sentiment_label": "pos", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nskyab", "comment_id": "ngmnanc", "author": "u/Mitch1musPrime", "created": "2025-09-28T10:42:52+00:00", "score": 2, "body": "I play the trailer in my HS English classroom to introduce my scifi unit.

By and large, the soldiers of the British army of the period were professionals. That is, they \"volunteered\" and served long enlistments of over a decade. They had the advantage of a high degree of training and experience.\n\nAlso, musket volleys were largely effective to maybe about 100-200 yards. A disciplined infantry unit could cross that distance in probably two to two and a half minutes, potentially less depending on terrain and unit aptitude.\n\nThe movie shows the French firing more volleys than they realistically would have been able to, and the volleys have far more of an effect than they likely would have in reality. Don't get me wrong, men would die from every volley, but it would be a less dramatic amount per volley, especially at a distance.\n\nThe reason why the men advance is to engage with the bayonet. The bayonet was really what won battles. If the men broke ranks, turned, and ran, they were likely to get run down by cavalry and killed or captured. If they stayed in formation and pushed with bayonets, they were more likely to survive (and win) the battle. Meanwhile, if the other army saw disciplined men advancing with bayonets and weren't equally or more disciplined, they were likely to break rank themselves. So, there was a logic to advancing with bayonets.\n\nThis is also why cavalry was still used in this time. Cavalry could cross the 100-200 yard distance to infantry formations extremely quickly- often musket equipped soldiers could only get 1 volley off on a cavalry formation before the cavalry were on top of them. So, infantry would form \"squares\" when engaged by cavalry, which would help protect them from the cavalry.\n\nBut, the infantry squares were large and immobile formations that required great discipline to hold. Artillery fire was especially devastating to infantry squares, and round shot could potentially take out entire ranks of men. So, if you were a general engaged in a linear war, you'd move your artillery into places where you hope they'll be useful and unlimber them. Then, you use your infantry to push the enemy infantry into a place where you can engage them with artillery- you'd do this primarily with bayonets. Then, you hit the enemy infantry with artillery until they have to move again. When they do this, you'd engage with cavalry and hopefully route them. Or, if you couldn't get your artillery into an ideal place, you could charge them with cavalry and hope they'd break ranks from that.\n\nThis changed with advent of rifled muskets. A trained soldier could actually aim a rifled musket and make hits out to several hundred yards. In the Crimean War, Russian cavalry charged an unsupported Highlander infantry regiment, because conventional wisdom was that infantry by themselves couldn't effectively engage cavalry from far enough way to effectively stop them. Instead, the Highlanders fired at 800 yards and 500 yards and inflicted a fair number of casualties on the Russian cavalrymen, who broke off the charge because they were being fired upon effectively.\n\nIncidentally, the British Army was actually very forward thinking with rifled muskets and it spent a lot of time training soldiers how to effectively use and aim rifled muskets. Even leading into WWI, British rifle training and marksmanship was some of the best in the world (which makes sense- they were a small nation with *many* colonial holdings. The British Army couldn't afford to throw wave after wave of men into enemy fire. The rifle gave them a huge advantage and was a key tool in their colonial endeavors).", "vader_compound": 0.6957, "sentiment_label": "pos", "agrees": 1, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nuraqk", "comment_id": "nh3iubo", "author": "u/Kundrew1", "created": "2025-09-30T23:36:32+00:00", "score": 14, "body": "‚ÄúDecided‚Äù implies soldier in this time period had a choice.", "vader_compound": 0.0, "sentiment_label": "neu", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nuraqk", "comment_id": "nh43kj7", "author": "u/snackofalltrades", "created": "2025-10-01T01:38:12+00:00", "score": 3, "body": "Can you explain what I just watched?

That clip above doesn't show the reality of the opposing line breaking from the bayonet advance. There's another critical thing the scene omits- smoke from the muskets. The French would not have been able to even *see* the British line from that position after their second or third shot from the amount of smoke that would have covered the battlefield, and needless to say, it's hard to shoot accurately at something you can't even see. And, very few (if any) line infantry companies would be disciplined enough to stand still and blind in a line to fire blindly at men with bayonets who were rapidly advancing. If they caught you while you were reloading (which you had to do after every shot) you'd certainly be dead.\n\n> I truly wish that strategists of the period could have realized better ways to fight than marching in a line into a barrage of fire.\n\nI do want to push back against this. I agree entirely that war is horrific and barbaric, and I don't want to give the impression that it's not. That being said, people in the past were just as smart, clever, and creative as we are today. And, ultimately, they wanted to win wars. Throwing the lives of men away for nothing was not a sustainable way to win battles and wars, and the militaries of the day coalesced on the tactics that worked best with the level of technology they had. Smooth bore muskets were useful weapons, but vastly limited and primitive compared to rifled muskets (and especially compared to rifles of today). Soldiers of the day were able to carry about 20-40 rounds of ammunition, and a black powder musket could only be fired so many times before it needed to be thoroughly cleaned. When looking at muskets, it's important to remember that while the weapon is a firearm, the most useful and effective part of that firearm was the bayonet. And, as discussed in that video I linked to, victories by bayonet often resulted in fewer casualties than trying to shoot things out from a distance.\n\nOne other thing I'd like to mention is that not all of the generals and leaders of the time were heartless monsters who threw away the lives of their men. Several times throughout his military career, the Duke of Wellington wept at the sight of his dead soldiers publicly.\n\nAfter defeating Napoleon at Waterloo, the Duke told a friend, \"I hope to God that I have fought my last battle. It is a bad thing to be always fighting. While in the thick of it I am too much occupied to feel anything; but it is wretched just after. It is quite impossible to think of glory.\"\n\nWellington was just one man (and a deeply flawed one at that), and other generals and leaders were certainly cruel and sometimes careless with the lives of their men, but by and large, these people were humans who tried to do their jobs to the best of their abilities. The tactics of the day may not make sense to us with our modern conception of warfare, but warfare at the time resembled fighting with pikes more than fighting with modern firearms.", "vader_compound": -0.9882, "sentiment_label": "neg", "agrees": 2, "disagrees": 1}\n{"post_id": "1nuraqk", "comment_id": "nhgkpci", "author": "u/echoNovemberNine", "created": "2025-10-03T00:15:02+00:00", "score": 1, "body": "It was an interesting video thanks for the share, though I do think it was a bit long to drill in it's main point that battles arent decisively won with musket fire.\n\n* Musket fire takes incredibly long time to drain the opposing armies numbers.\n* A single catalytic bayonet charge will end a battle within minutes.\n\nThe video is understood, yet my point remains. I will elaborate a bit, that it took technology to highlight the absurdity of the line infantry. You can never convince me to walk forward into a hail of musket fire. Could you convince yourself to walk forward into a line of musket fire? It rejects any agency the individual has over their own life. Any other fighting doctrine at the very least gives the soldier some more autonomy over their survival. But walking in an organized line is simply rolling a dice to see if you will be the randomly selected target of the musket ball. That's the absurdity, being asked to play the musket-ball-death-lottery with each step forward you increase your chances of winning, or losing depending on how you look at it.\n\nIf you were required to pick any war doctrine/era to take part in, my last choice would be participating in a line infantry.

One such example is Thea von Harbou who‚Äôs best known as Fritz Lang‚Äôs second wife. She was a fervent Nazi member who was also a massive fan of Mahatma Gandhi(?????) for some weirdest twisted reasons tied to core Nazi logic. (Something something Aryan origin in India and whatnot, can‚Äôt clearly remember)\n\nMishima Yukio and his fellow Japanese far right activists were even weirder. Their fascism is closely intertwined with traditionalist view that Japan should hold on its own against ‚Äòthe monsters and animals of US and UK,‚Äô and the authoritarian aesthetics that finds the core of the traditional Japanese culture in Tenno/Emperor.

That means MANY thought it was bad, or not worth an extra viewing. Also, watch out with the Audience Scores of RottenTomatoes. I recall Black Adam having 92% at one point early on, one of the highest DCEU audience scores ever, up there with TDK (it's since dropped to 87%, same as Dial of Destiny). We all know that's f'ing ridiculous for Black Adam to have 92%. If we accept there are basement virgins downvoting any certain movie (politics, hating on an actress, etc), could there equally be a contingent of fan voters who blindly give movies 10/10 just because they love the franchise? \n\n71% critics is also shaky. Positive, yes, but dropping 12 more % points and it hits Rotten aka No Recommend.\n\nLast of all is the box office that cannot be ignored.  $384 million worldwide is so dismally low, it may have killed the franchise, at least for a long time - I call that a mission failure. It tells me people did not want to do repeat visits to this movie (for many it was not that enjoyable), or tell friends, family, coworkers to see this movie. Word of mouth was dead. I don't see any memes or quotes on social media from this movie. I can't even remember any character names, despite so many being introduced. It's not a classic Indy film for many, or certainly didn't penetrate the culture the way the OG trilogy did.\n\nOne cannot use the late 2023 COVID excuse either, because that year saw record-shattering box office all over the place. People were begging to go back to theaters: Barbie (over $1.5B worldwide), Super Mario Bros (over $1.3B), Oppenheimer ($976M), Guardians of the Galaxy 3 ($846M), Wonka ($635M), The Little Mermaid ($570M, and this movie was viciously attacked before the first trailer even landed and given a chance), and that shitty ass Ant Man 3: Quantumania *still* made $477M. John Wick 4 ($447M) and **Meg 2: The Trench BEAT Indiana Jones Dial of Destiny for crying out loud ($398M).**\n\nNo, Indiana Jones Dial of Destiny does not convincingly win in *every* metric, and that's why there's no word on any other IJ movie project or sequel from Mangold.

Spending that insane amount of money and losing so much is poor, stupid, reckless business. Studios won't last if they continue doing that. That is why the resulting $384M gross was a massive, tragic disappointment. James Mangold even said [he felt hurt and down by the reception](https://deadline.com/2024/12/james-mangold-on-how-he-helped-timothee-chalamet-give-magnificent-voice-to-bob-dylan-1236194822/) (which means it was not universally loved).\n\n>It was a very crowded and packed summer at the box office.\n\nIt was crowded for Oppenheimer too, a 3-hour movie with no action scenes and all talk. And it still did well. Also, Dial of Destiny actually had a free window for good business for a good 2-3 weeks. No competition at all and they could stretch their legs. Plenty of time to make insane money (Dead Reckoning, Barbenheimer would come out 2-3 weeks after Indy). Dead Reckoning, arguably, wouldn't even step on the toes of Dial of Destiny. People would likely see both, or the demographics are slightly different where one does not affect the other.\n\nIf crowdedness is the reason a movie's box office total is not what it should be, how does *any* movie succeed in the June-August summer months?

Also, Indiana Jones reached out for that hat in the end, in a \"It's over...kinda, maybe.....no it's over.....unless?\". That hat is symbolic and iconic at this point.

That said, I went ahead and saw it twice because I was still wrestling with it (hahahahahahahaha) a bit and although I enjoyed it both times, it didn‚Äôt leave me with a strong feeling in the end. \n\nThe Rock is, indeed, doing some real work here and that‚Äôs nice to see. I think Oscar talk is a bit insane for this as it‚Äôs probably the most in-his-wheelhouse performance possible being a biopic on a gentle giant MMA fighter. But he is absolutely putting forth a performance that clearly means a lot to him to be able to portray and while I never doubted that it was still The Rock under that nose, it is a compelling performance.\n\nThe score and the look of the movie are probably what I appreciated the most. There‚Äôs this low-key jazz score that kind of keys in when he starts to get really focused and almost ramps up continuously the whole movie until you‚Äôre in those final fights. The song choices are interesting but there is one scene set to the entirety of Jungleland by Springsteen that is just fantastic. Easily the best part of the movie, especially considering it‚Äôs not just a snippet of the 9+ minute song but a full scene that plays it unbroken in the background and acts out the highs and lows of the entire song.\n\nI have a ceiling with sports biopics, most biopics really. It‚Äôs just so hard to balance good drama and real events and do all the things right you need to do with them while also trying not to do the things that every single one of them tend to do. For this one I had a hard time parsing out how it wanted me to feel about all of this. The story of Kerr losing for the first time and the spiral that sends him down is a great story and I have no doubt this movie is exactly what Safdie wants it to be, but when credits rolled I was just didn‚Äôt really know how to feel. Maybe it stands as more of a portrait of someone who was important to the sport and deserves more recognition, but it just didn't come together.\n\nI did enjoy it scene to scene and while I think a lot of people will be quick to villainize Blunt (obviously not saying everything she did was perfect and great) it did feel like one of those slightly toxic relationships you see in life where every little thing is an offense but the fights make the good times burn a little brighter. Honestly I was more interested in Coleman played by Ryan Bader, interesting parallels there. He does it for his family while Kerr doesn‚Äôt want a family and seems to be generally against any sort of growth or movement. Of the people in Kerr‚Äôs life, the tragedy seemed to be that the person he wanted to be with was the one that didn‚Äôt know how to help him all the time. 7/10 for me.

They were on a hiding to nothing.\n\nBut also, the script was shit and made no effort to find a way to tell the story in an interesting way. Instead it just had Ender (poor Asa Butterfield) say all his expositional thoughts as dialogue, which breaks the Show Don't Tell rule, the golden rule of movie storytelling. \"I will wear the shame of this genocide forever\" is, to me, one of the worst lines of dialogue ever spoken in a blockbuster film. Don't tell us he's ashamed. SHOW US the shame.\n\nAnd as a further pet peeve from a Kiwi, if they wanted to make Mazer Rackham Maori (book-accurate) and give him a traditional Maori facial tattoo, cast Cliff Curtis or Tem Morrison as Mazer Rackham.

He didn't kill her, and the movie dropped some hints as to why he didn't. For one, we don't see it happen. Just a gunshot and he leaves the room. Maybe he shot her somewhere non-fatal like she did to him, to make things even? But the reason I don't think he killed her is when he talks to Philly's wife, he says he kept his promise and killed her... HOWEVER, he also has a history of lying about killing someone, like what happened with Kincaid. He knew Kincaid was alive but told Grofield that he killed him. He ALSO left Kincaid alive again when he passed out after being interrogated...!<\n\n>!So, yeah I'm not convinced he killed her.!<\n\nOverall the movie was a decent watch.

This is the ‚ÄúI coulda been a contender‚Äù scene, and it has been parodied endlessly (most memorably by Robert De Niro in ‚ÄúRaging Bull‚Äù). But it still has its power to make us feel Terry‚Äôs pain, and even the pain of Charley, who has been forced to pull a gun on his brother. Here is Kazan on Brando:\n\n> ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ what was extraordinary about his performance, I feel, is the contrast of the tough-guy front and the extreme delicacy and gentle cast of his behavior. What other actor, when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something shameful, would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the gentleness of a caress? Who else could read `Oh, Charley!‚Äô in a tone of reproach that is so loving and so melancholy and suggests the terrific depth of pain?‚Äù\n\n> .........\n\n> Schulberg‚Äôs screenplay straddles two styles ‚Äì the emerging realism and the stylized gangster picture. To the latter tradition belong lines like ‚ÄúHe could sing, but he couldn‚Äôt fly,‚Äù when the squealer is thrown off the roof.\n\n> To the former: ‚ÄúYou know how the union works? You go to a meeting, you make a motion, the lights go out, then you go out.‚Äù Brando‚Äôs ‚Äúcontender‚Äù speech is so famous it‚Äôs hard to see anew, but watch the film again and you feel the reality of the sadness between the two men, and the simple words that express it.\n\n> ‚ÄúOn the Waterfront‚Äù was nominated for 11 Oscars and won eight. Ironically, the other three nominations were all for best supporting actor, where Cobb, Malden and Steiger split the vote. Today the story no longer seems as fresh; both the fight against corruption and the romance fall well within ancient movie conventions.

A perfect distillation of what Disney used to do so well and that they've basically abandoned now. This movie could have easily been one note, but the way they escalate the racism stakes from the team to the parents to the townspeople to the institutions keeps it very watchable even if the structure is basically comedy beat - emotional beat - team losing - switch up strat - team winning. The pacing is pretty impressive. 45 minutes at Football camp, then it covers an entire Football season and zooms in on four or five games without feeling too repetitive. \n\nDenzel is immaculate in this. For someone who has basically never turned in a bad performance, this is exactly the kind of mid-tier stuff he was made to elevate to Godly levels. This might be his most iconic performance to me, obviously he has more important and better performances like Philadelphia and Malcolm X, but you can show Remember the Titans to a 10 year old and they'd understand the power of Denzel. He‚Äôs funny, committed, and he commands this entire movie in such a powerful way. Will Patton is also a bit of glue for this movie, he has a great arc where he has the most to lose by Boone staying head coach and he‚Äôs really not fully ‚Äúin‚Äù on Boone until that game where the refs are making unfair calls. But the setup to the moment where he decides is him being present in all of the previous scenes, seeing what Boone does for these kids and his conviction. Also Coach Yoast is such a great name. \n\nThere are also, like, eight other smaller performances in this that are incredible from the players to the parents. Bertiere's mom has, like, two minutes of screen time and is amazing? Her line reading of, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt *want* to get to know him!‚Äù has stuck with me all these years and despite having basically no more lines still has two great scenes. There‚Äôs just so much room for everyone to contribute in this. I didn‚Äôt even realize Avon Barksdale was in this even though I had seen this movie five times before I had ever even heard of The Wire. Ethan Suplee has maybe never been so perfectly cast as this. Even child Hayden Panettiere is fantastic in this and has a ton of scenes with a range of emotions. Really, really well cast film and it‚Äôs probably its greatest strength. \n\nThis is a classic for me and rewatching it was still as good as it used to be. Enough needle drops to break a stereo but a great soundtrack of half Southern Creedence and half The Temptations. It‚Äôs certainly not some heavy rumination on racism, but Shane Gillis was right when he said it‚Äôs about how important Football is in America, that only the high school team going 4-0 in Alabama could defeat racism. 9/10.", "vader_compound": 0.9978, "sentiment_label": "pos", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nwmwbs", "comment_id": "nhi1193", "author": "u/joethetipper", "created": "2025-10-03T06:03:40+00:00", "score": 26, "body": "‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your mama over there?

The chase involves Popeye commandeering a civilian's car (a 1971 Pontiac LeMans) and frantically chasing an elevated train on which a hitman is trying to escape. The scene, coordinated by Bill Hickman, was filmed in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, roughly running under the BMT West End Line (now the D, ‚ÄãR, and ‚ÄãW trains, then the B train), which runs on an elevated track above Stillwell Avenue, 86th Street, and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the 62nd Street station. At that point, the train hits a train stop but is going too fast to stop in time and collides with the train ahead of it, which has just left the station.\n\n>The scene's most famous shot is from a front bumper mount and shows the streets from a low angle. Director of photography Owen Roizman wrote in American Cinematographer magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed; this effect can be seen on a car at a red light whose exhaust pipe is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss Doyle's car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred that were left in the film. Friedkin said he used Santana's cover of Peter Green's song \"Black Magic Woman\" during editing to help shape the chase sequence. The song does not appear in the film, but the chase scene \"did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the music\".\n\n>The scene concludes with Doyle confronting Nicoli at the stairs leading to the elevated train track and shooting him as he tries to run back up them, as captured in a still shot used in a theatrical release poster for the film. Many of the police officers who were advisers for the film objected to the scene on the grounds that shooting a suspect in the back is murder, not self-defense, but Friedkin stood by it, saying he was \"secure in my conviction that that's exactly what Eddie Egan [the model for Doyle] would have done, and Eddie was on the set while all of this was being shot\".\n\nRumored they did not have permits to film this scene.", "vader_compound": -0.9634, "sentiment_label": "neg", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nxcmrt", "comment_id": "nhmze56", "author": "u/Transformer_Jay", "created": "2025-10-04T00:05:58+00:00", "score": 5, "body": "The fact that they didn‚Äôt get permits to shoot this chase and just had people at intersections on walkie talkies saying it was clear makes this chase for me.", "vader_compound": 0.0516, "sentiment_label": "neu", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nxcmrt", "comment_id": "nhn2mtc", "author": "u/StultusNosferatu", "created": "2025-10-04T00:26:57+00:00", "score": 1, "body": "Interesting enough, restaurant chain \"Popeyes\" get its name from...", "vader_compound": 0.4019, "sentiment_label": "neu", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nxcmrt", "comment_id": "nhn3s2d", "author": "u/diarrheaticavenger", "created": "2025-10-04T00:34:24+00:00", "score": 1, "body": "Filmed entirely on location in France üá´üá∑", "vader_compound": 0.0, "sentiment_label": "neu", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nxcmrt", "comment_id": "nhncnzx", "author": "u/Enthusiasms", "created": "2025-10-04T01:32:28+00:00", "score": 1, "body": "Just something about that late 60's-early 70's bright red blood too.", "vader_compound": 0.4404, "sentiment_label": "neu", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nxcmrt", "comment_id": "nhnnff2", "author": "u/NotaRepublican85", "created": "2025-10-04T02:45:40+00:00", "score": 1, "body": "Am I the only one who was pretty underwhelmed by this movie?

Mallory, Jay, and Alex will be back at 6 PM ET today to answer any questions.

We're the filmmaking team behind DREAM EATER, a new found-footage horror film out in theaters October 24th.\n\nHere's the trailer for our film:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivl9iXq98TU\n\nAbout Dream Eater: \n\nDuring their holiday at a cabin deep in the snowy Laurentian mountains, Mallory documents her boyfriend Alex‚Äôs violent parasomnia. When his sleepwalking gets worse, Mallory suspects the cause may be something far more sinister than a mere sleep disorder. Using her expertise as a documentary filmmaker, Mallory digs into Alex‚Äôs shadowy past and begins to unravel a decades-long mystery steeped in trauma and the occult. As darkness closes in, an ancient evil awakens ‚Äì plunging the couple into a downward spiral of madness and horror that threatens to destroy more than just their relationship. By the time the end credits roll, DREAM EATER will have you questioning who you‚Äôre really sleeping next to at night.\n\nWebsite: https://horrorsectionstudios.com/dream-eater/\n\nAsk us anything!

I'm loving it. So I have a few answers to this. I'll try to go in order of when they fucked me up.  \n1. JURASSIC PARK - When I was 4 my Uncle Terry (who was instrumental in my filmmaking journey as a kid) showed me Jurassic Park when he was babysitting me (against my parents direct order) and I had nightmares for weeks. It's still a topic of conversation that comes up at family dinners where he gets reamed out my by mother.\n\n2. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - I remember seeing the original VHS artwork for this at my local Videoflicks and became obsessed with it. My mom wouldn't rent it saying the film was disgusting. That made me want to see it more. I didn't see it until I was about 10, but the 6 year old me holding that VHS in the store still gives me chills. \n\n3. IDLE HANDS - In 99 when Idle Hands came out, I remember my parents brought it home in one of those new at the time AWFUL VHS rental cases that had that thick black lock at the bottom which was impossible to open. And I remember they told me there was no way I was allowed to watch this which just killed me because I just loved the trailer and was obsessed with the leatherface reference that Seth Green did in the trailer. So against their wishes (and my better judgement) I snuck downstairs when I heard them put it on and watched from behind a couch. It took me less than 5 minutes to scream in terror when Anton's mom is pulled under the bed and brutally murdered. It's still one of my all time favourite films and is criminally slept on in the cult movie conversation. \n\n4. BLACK CHRISTMAS - When I was about 10 my mom showed me this cause she was sick of watching age approproiate films for me. This changed my life. I owe her so much. \n\n5. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - Then she finally let me watch TCM. I owe her twice. \n\n\\-Alex", "vader_compound": -0.9833, "sentiment_label": "neg", "agrees": 0, "disagrees": 0}\n{"post_id": "1nthwc2", "comment_id": "ngwqbvx", "author": "u/DreamEaterAMA", "created": "2025-09-29T22:27:37+00:00", "score": 3, "body": "Hey there u/theguyinblue2 !!

So we actually edit all of our films ourselves as well! Vigo Vasquez is a pseudonym that we use that represents 2 of our favourite film characters (bonus points for anyone who can guess which characters and what movie they are from!) which is a huge advantage when we are writing. We write to direct to edit the film so we are incredibly conscious of how we are going to piece the entire film together as we are constructing the scene on the page, and the same goes for when we are storyboarding. Similar to how Damien Chazzelle describes his process - we know exactly where the camera will be in any given line of the script. To add to that, we are very conscious of flow when constructing the edit so there were actually a small handful of scenes that once we saw it in the cut, we realized that even though we liked the scenes they were stunting the flow.

I found it hard to believe that Walken would be someone who would xxxx his son's girlfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the good stuff: I don't involve myself with rural crime rings, so seeing this one was a new experience.

Will it be confusing, fondness, fear, or warmth?  It's such an incredibly powerful film where less is way, way more.  Very little dialogue.  Even less of a plot.  Yet I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks after watching.  11/10 for me.\n\nA few things:  regarding your statement that Calum committed suicide after their vacation together.  I'm not sure if you were implying it happened *right* after or just simply at some point later in time; if the former, I'm not sure we can make that assumption.  Also, I don't know if we can assume that his breakdown triggered a trauma, or if he's just overwhelmed by the relationship he has with his daughter, distilled into an intensity by the birthday celebration.  Occasionally my daughter will display some minuscule sign of affection toward me that just overwhelms me in way that's both joyful but also melancholic.
