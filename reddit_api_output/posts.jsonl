After that I only had to show the desk clerk our interview notice and my mom's form of ID, as well as my CAC to verify the method in which how we got the GC interview notice. The interview lasted around 25 minutes or so and we were approved on the spot.

I am happy to provide firm or probono recommendations via DM, but nothing more). \n\nHi all, \n\nUsing a throwaway. I have been lurking here for a while without commenting anything, but I feel like I need to give my two cents given the amount of posts on this sub. Excuse any typos or grammatical errors. I am typing this while I am highly caffeinated and dealing with my own caseload. \n\nFellow immigration attorneys, please correct me if I'm wrong on any points. If you're not a legal professional, I do not want to hear it. \n\nFinally, none of this is legal advice. Please always consult with an attorney before making any decisions on your specific case. \n\n\n**1. Will DACA be taken away?**\n\nRemember, nothing can be guaranteed. Genuinely, no one knows what will happen. \n\nI will say that in my opinion, likely no-- the economy makes way too much money from DACA folks. I do believe that they will dangle it like a carrot to appease right-wing voters. Major corporations employ DACAmented folks. The SSN from work permits have allowed more tax revenue to come in. Too much is at stake. Legally, the legal arguments at the courts surrounding DACA involve constitutional rights, which themselves aren't going anywhere anytime soon. It's honestly just a topic that is often talked about, but hardly understood by many. \n\n**2. What about I-131F PIP?**\n\nAs of today (11/7), this has been revoked. \n\n**3. Will the mass deportations actually happen? Is it actually feasible?**\n\nI want to put this into perspective. There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. Currently, DHS has about 92,000 officers, and ICE has about 21,000 officers. It is asinine to try to achieve this. \n\nLet's say it actually does begin and people are getting rounded up. Guess what? Not all undocumented folks are just undocumented-- many have TPS, pending asylum applications, pending T/U Visas, and work permits (see my point regarding #1). Unless a migrant has an expedited removal (not likely), DHS/ICE still needs to process each deportee, assign them A#s, and follow basic procedures. If they don't? That's a very easy way to reverse a deportation order. It's the equivalent of convicting someone of murder using a confession made under a very obvious 4/5th amendment violation. Slam dunk case. \n\nOh, and you know who has to handle all of these deportation cases? Federal DHS attorneys. They're already overworked, and they tend to exercise discretion. If no discretion, the overworked ones tend to gloss over cases and provide weak arguments. Only major attention is paid to serious crimes. You'd be surprised the amount of times DHS attorneys have gotten my clients' names wrong or made procedurally embarrassing typos. \n\n**4. What about ICE roundups?**\n\nThey still happen. Still need to follow procedures. If not, lawsuits and lots of deportation reversals. \n\n**5. Will there be a plan to denaturalize? Is it actually feasible? What about birthright citizenship?**\n\nSee #1 and #3. \n\n**6. What is likely to happen coming January?**\n\nIMO, the end of prosecutorial discretion in deportation proceedings will likely happen immediately. This means that DHS attorneys will have to prosecute all cases. However, see my point for #3. \n\n**7. What will happen to my pending USCIS case? What will USCIS do now?**\n\nVaries. USCIS is highly understaffed right now, and the backlogs are ridiculous. My guess is that between now and December, there will be a push to try to get as many I-485/N400s adjudicated before January. This may result in fees increasing for future applications. \n\n**8. Should I try to file my [insert case here] with the USCIS?**\n\nI cannot answer this. I highly recommend an attorney. Unless your case involves a complex immigration history (think border apprehensions, previous deportations, court hearings or USCIS interviews), probono organizations may be able to take your case. \n\n**9. Can greencards be taken away?**\n\nGreencard refers to lawful permanent resident status (aka \"LPR\"). LPR status is given under a plethora amount of reasons-- each have their own statutory and common law requirements. Yes, theonewhoshallnotbenamed definitely enacted policies that made obtaining these harder, but not impossible. Again though, to take an LPR status, the USCIS is required to issue a Notice of Intent to Rescind, and it would allow you to argue your case. \n\nAgain, USCIS is backlogged. When backlogs continue, immigration attorneys threaten mandamus lawsuits. Who has to handle these? US Attorneys. Guess what they will try to do? Try to dismiss as quickly and easily as possible, bringing the process back to square one. What do lawyers hate (among many things)? Their success ratings going down. \n\n**10. I legit think that they're gonna throw the whole rulebook away and just try to remove DACA, deport people, and do whatever erratically.**\n\nThen we'll cross that bridge if we get to it. IMO, I never underestimated THAT ONE and his team. They are strategic and play the irrational and ludicrous card very well. Do I think they actually want to achieve the above? Definitely. However, I don't think it will come from the White House necessarily. They'll try to slowly change the social and political atmosphere, beginning at home. \n\nThis means that the revolution starts at home. It starts in how we educate ourselves and each other. It starts by breaking generational curses and preventing history from repeating itself. It means raising our children better. It means being in community. \n\n**11. I want to leave the US.**\n\nI can't blame you. I cannot give any information on this, and this is beyond the scope of this subreddit. \n\n**12. So, what now?**\n\nAs naive as it is for me to say, I think good always wins. The right is banking on your apathy, despair, and helplessness. \n\n**13. I'm glad that this is all happening. We need stricter immigration laws.**\n\nWhy are you in this sub? Let me know when you've joined the Olympics though, because the amount of mental gymnastics you are doing to justify your ignorance should be enough to give you a gold medal. \n\n\nEDIT: WOW. Lots of questions. I promise to try to get to as many as I can. I am but a mere attorney trying to meet his billable hours and trying to comfort my immigrant parents at the same time. \n\n\nEDIT #2: I'm adding some extra points that might help cover the general theme of questions I've been getting: \n\n\n\n**A. What about Operation Wetback?**\n\nCrackdowns and ICE sweeps are still happening. Furthermore, they gotta be processed still. This means that they need to be in detention centers while ICE gets the proper paperwork from the deportee's home country (or Mexico), set up transportation, and deport them. Yes, this includes if it's even in a sweep and go type of crackdown. \n\nI don't underestimate the vile nature of THAT ONE and what he wants to do, but I mention the facts as someone who is heavily involved in this legal work. \n\n\n**B. What will change with my [enter type of application]? Do you think orangeblob will change it?**\n\nNo law has changed. This includes statutory and common law. Your case will move forward as is unless told otherwise. \n\nIn terms of likelihood-- again, look at #1 and #3. They can dangle the hateful rhetoric as a carrot to right-wingers all they want, but money talks the most.\n\n\n**C. Will family petitions change? Employment?**\n\nThey didn't during 2017-2021. They very likely will not change here. Major corporations, especially tech ones, rely on employment-based petitions heavily. \n\n\n**D. Everyone said don't worry and things got worse years ago. I'm scared.**\n\nThis is exactly what they want you to feel. This is their goal. This is why I made my post. Let this fear and grief transmute into courage and motivation for a better world for all of us. Overall, it's not attorneys or people in fancy suits that make the most change. It's the community leaders, the librarians, the students, the homeless shelter managers, and the barbers that know the names of everyone on the block. Hope is not lost. \n\n**E. I came here the ‚Äúright way,‚Äù so everyone should follow the law/it‚Äôs only ‚Äúillegals‚Äù that have to worry/any other unoriginal variation**\n\nDM me for resources on how to have better empathy. \n\n\n**EDIT #3 (FINAL EDIT).**\n\nFew more frequently asked questions: \n\n**F. Why do you think there will be a push to adjudicate AOS/N400? Isn't USCIS understaffed?** \n\nIt happened post election in 2016. Pragmatically, it was probably because USCIS was expecting a large influx of applications come 2017. They decided to increase the fees, but they needed to give proper notice and time for people to file AOS/N400. Thus, leading to a mass influx of applications. \n\nAs for adjudication: N400s are the last hurdle for most folks, and they're generally not as difficult to adjudicate as other applications. It's another application officers can remove from their plate. Immediate relative based AOS or AOS based on current priority dates (without inadmissibility issues) are also generally easy to adjudicate. Yes, they are understaffed, but sometimes USCIS can shift focus briefly to some applications.\n\nWill all of this happen come 2025? That's the hope. My naive side wants to believe that USCIS wants to make as many people residents and citizens as quickly as possible. There were a numerous amount of natz approvals in my firm right before the election. My guess is that they wanted people to vote.\n\nNow, do I think CONSULAR ones will also get pushed? No clue. That didn‚Äôt happen 2017-2021. See Item G below. \n\n**G. What about I-130s with priority dates? What will happen now?**\n\nThis type of question is complex for several reasons. (1) I-130s are provided for all sorts of reasons, both family and employment based, (2) It depends on the type, the country, and the field office handling this case and (3) It also depends if consular processing will need to get involved. \n\nRight now, nothing has changed. This means that the priority dates on the visa bulletins are ones to look at. \n\nWhat a lot of immigration attorneys do is if there's a valid reason to expedite (most common being a family medical emergency back home), then they request it. If that doesn't work, a threat of a lawsuit sometimes helps. If not, then we file a mandamus. The key to doing all of this is for when the I-130 has been pending for longer than the processing times. Keep in mind that US Attorneys are not a fan of mandamus because they are contractually required to take these cases, so they try to dismiss as quickly as possible. This usually leads to the government agency making their decision on the case.  \n\nNow, if consular processing is involved: Each consular office operates on their own timeline and their own procedures. They hardly post these procedures. Guatemala takes about 6 months, and Peru takes about 2 years. Some attorneys also threaten to involve the courts for delays here, but consulates are controlled by the Department of State, making this a bit more challenging. \n\nNow, the burning question: will the above change? Pragmatically, overrunning and delaying the above is a poor financial decision, and money talks. You don't wanna mess with the golden nuggets of massive corporations. Can it happen though? Yes. Orangeblob did make the process slower for folks, and yes RFEs were issued annoyingly often. However, there is always room for argument and litigation, so not all hope is lost. \n\nWhat about priority dates? Will they change? Priority dates vary on visa type, availability, and country of origin. There could be delays, yes. No certainty just yet. \n\n**H. What about [insert student or business related visa]?** \n\nI unfortunately do not have experience in this field of immigration law. I cannot give a proper educated answer. \n\n**I. What about asylum? Title 42?**\n\nToo soon to tell. Asylum interviews are in a massive backlog at the moment. In 2018, when DV/gang based claims were slashed, many asylum offices tried to help by \"stalling\" their decisions. It put people in limbo, but there was at least no referrals to court or initiation of removal proceedings. Will that happen here? Maybe, but again, too soon to tell. \n\n**J. If ICE starts rounding people up, am I next? Can I get picked up? What if I have an upcoming court hearing? Will they deport me?**\n\nThere is generally a priority system for ICE. They tend to be: those with pending removal orders (especially if removal order was based on criminal conviction) or those convicted of deportable crimes. \n\nIf you have a criminal conviction, do not freak out. Not all convictions are deportable ones. This is a specific legal definition that is too complicated for me to type out. If you were charged after 2010, you must be provided with full legal advice of any immigration consequences of a potential conviction. \n\nHaving an upcoming court hearing (even via a CBP One appt) doesn't necessarily make you a priority. Some of those hearings may be for pending asylum cases and there are no crim issues. \n\nEven if you have a previous deportation order, there are still options and there are still ways to fight a deportation. \n\nIf you're still scared about being on a priority, think of this: A cop is doing speed checks on a 65mph speed limit freeway. There are a lot of cars on the freeway. Who is he likely to go after? Someone going 67, 75, or 90? Someone with a pending removal order (especially due to a serious criminal conviction) is much higher up there. Remember, if you fall under this category, there are options and there are ways to protect you. \n\n**K. But what if [insert scary scenario]? These are all just legal protections, and he wants to get rid of all of this. He's a fascist.** \n\nRemember, they are banking on your anxiety and uncertainty. The need for certainty and comfort during turbulent times is human nature. What is also human nature is innovation, the quest for justice, and community. Even if the worst comes to light, you have so many folks who are on your side and ready to fight for you (not just attorneys). \n\nHere is another metaphor I like to use: In the show Supernatural, Lucifer knew that Sam was going to give consent to take over his body. He had the whole timeline planned, down to the smallest detail. You know what he underestimated? Sam's love for his brother, Dean. Sure, Lucifer could predict human behavior, but he could never outsmart it. I say this here as well: don't underestimate the love that people have for one another. (also, the first five seasons in Supernatural were the superior ones, and I will immediately block anyone who tells me otherwise).\n\n**L. I messaged you requesting recommendations for nonprofit orgs and firms. When can I hear back?**\n\nI will do what I can. I will most likely answer these questions over the weekend. Any specific legal questions, unless something urgently stands out to me, I will likely not be able to answer.  \n\n\n", "subreddit": "USCIS", "comments_total": 80, "comments_pos": 35, "comments_neg": 8, "comments_neu": 37, "agree_hits": 0, "disagree_hits": 0, "support_index": 0.814}\n{"post_id": "1ltlanr", "title": "Became a Citizen after 26 years!!", "author": "u/Ajax4557", "score": 2655, "num_comments": 165, "created": "2025-07-07T04:44:32+00:00", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1ltlanr/became_a_citizen_after_26_years/", "is_self": false, "image_urls": ["https://i.redd.it/5d0ljp8jtdbf1.jpeg"], "selftext": null, "subreddit": "USCIS", "comments_total": 80, "comments_pos": 59, "comments_neg": 0, "comments_neu": 21, "agree_hits": 0, "disagree_hits": 0, "support_index": 1.0}\n{"post_id": "1lmkuyj", "title": "After 25 years, I can finally say, and with a lot of pride, that I am an American citizen üéäüéâüá∫üá∏üò≠", "author": "u/liamthegooner", "score": 2446, "num_comments": 237, "created": "2025-06-28T11:45:04+00:00", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1lmkuyj/after_25_years_i_can_finally_say_and_with_a_lot/", "is_self": false, "image_urls": ["https://i.redd.it/flrhy369on9f1.jpeg"], "selftext": null, "subreddit": "USCIS", "comments_total": 80, "comments_pos": 57, "comments_neg": 2, "comments_neu": 21, "agree_hits": 1, "disagree_hits": 0, "support_index": 0.967}\n{"post_id": "1kepdw8", "title": "Be careful out there", "author": "u/Mrkinkade", "score": 2428, "num_comments": 768, "created": "2025-05-04T17:31:34+00:00", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1kepdw8/be_careful_out_there/", "is_self": false, "image_urls": ["https://i.redd.it/eety23l1wsye1.jpeg"], "selftext": null, "subreddit": "USCIS", "comments_total": 80, "comments_pos": 13, "comments_neg": 11, "comments_neu": 56, "agree_hits": 1, "disagree_hits": 0, "support_index": 0.56}\n{"post_id": "1i8arwf", "title": "Judge in Seattle blocks Trump order on birthright citizenship nationwide", "author": "u/lovetree77", "score": 2351, "num_comments": 144, "created": "2025-01-23T18:50:35+00:00", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1i8arwf/judge_in_seattle_blocks_trump_order_on_birthright/", "is_self": false, "image_urls": [], "selftext": null, "subreddit": "USCIS", "comments_total": 80, "comments_pos": 10, "comments_neg": 12, "comments_neu": 58, "agree_hits": 3, "disagree_hits": 0, "support_index": 0.52}\n{"post_id": "1h7t1fl", "title": "Disappointed in my country", "author": "u/Aggravating_Salad604", "score": 2199, "num_comments": 849, "created": "2024-12-06T04:22:52+00:00", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1h7t1fl/disappointed_in_my_country/", "is_self": true, "image_urls": [], "selftext": "I'm an American citizen who is filing for my spouse.

I started with the National Benefits Center (NBC) in Lee‚Äôs Summit, MO in 2015 and initially, I mostly adjudicated family based (FB) adjustment of status (AOS) applications and associated ones like I-765 and I-131. I also worked or had experience with I-290b, I-360 SIJ, I-140 EB1A and B, employment based (EB) AOS, and a whole lot of customer service positions (congressional liaison, USCIS HQ contact, SRMT team). My last few years as a supervisor were spent as the main point of contact (POC) for parole-based work permits (I-765 C11s). I would love to write up a separate post on that experience sometime.\n\nIn April of this year, USCIS offered up a deferred resignation program (DRP), basically a copy of the infamous ‚ÄúFork‚Äù offer DOGE and those clowns offered up to most of the federal government in Feb. USCIS exempted itself from the original DRP, but decided to offer it up along with early retirement and cash buyout payments. I was already planning on leaving the agency for a variety of reasons but decided to take advantage of this offer and was placed on paid, administrative leave 5/4/25 and will officially be separated on 10/4/25. At that point, I‚Äôll be back practicing immigration law and doing my best to continue helping people navigate our purposedly complicated immigration system. ¬†\n\nWith that introduction out of the way, I‚Äôd like to offer some thoughts on USCIS as it is now, and maybe more importantly, where it‚Äôs headed over the next few years and what all of it means for applicants. There are also a lot of current and former USCIS employees lurking here including some former colleagues, and they may have a different viewpoint than me on some things. So this is just me talking in my personal capacity, not on behalf of the agency or other employees of the agency. ¬†\n\nUSCIS, like any large organization, can only complete its mission when it has a skilled, motivated, and engaged workforce. It‚Äôs taken a huge hit to all three of these since Trump 2.0 came into office. Many of the best and brightest throughout the agency left; I believe it‚Äôs been between 2,500 and 3,000 departures since 1/20/25. This represents around a 10% reduction in the agency‚Äôs headcount. A lot of the people who left had decades of experience and/or skills and abilities not likely to be replaced easily. The employees left behind are now overworked, stressed, and unmotivated due to draconian workplace changes such as RTO and flexible schedules eliminated (USCIS had successfully and broadly implemented telework since the early 2010s). We‚Äôre talking about cramming officers who‚Äôve worked successfully for years at home into conference and breakrooms with only their laptops. A hiring freeze affecting most positions in the agency also means most open positions are not, and will not for some time, be filled. The Agency terminated the collective bargaining agreement with the Union in August, another major blow to what was left of morale. There are still many great people left at USCIS, people who want to do their best and will continue to do their jobs effectively no matter how hard this admin makes it. There are still strong leaders left who continue to work hard for their employees and the applicants who pay their salaries. But it‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that morale is at rock bottom and there doesn‚Äôt appear to be much hope for improvement at this point in time.\n\nUSCIS went from a low point in morale in the summer of 2020 (Trump 1.0 with new USICS Dir. Joe Edlow then serving as de facto acting director) with a hiring freeze and proposed 70% employee furlough, to a high point in 2024 (generous admin leave given by Sec Mayorkas and record bonuses/time off awards, a director who actually cared and engaged with employees), and now back again to a new low in morale. It‚Äôs certainly possible some ISOs may be happier now; some field office ISOs may never have teleworked and/or enjoy issuing NTAs more now. But I think for the vast majority of agency employees, it‚Äôs now become just another job. They are villainized by their own leadership (Sec Noem on down), any work/life balance taken away, and being made to do additional work that doesn‚Äôt help them, the American people, or their applicants. There‚Äôs a reason why the government wide employee satisfaction (FEVS) survey was suspended this year! ¬†¬†¬†\n\nPolicy-wise, USCIS has been abruptly shifted from its true purpose and mission of adjudicating immigration benefit requests to an enforcement support arm for which it has no congressional mandate and to be blunt, no desire for as well. This means more vetting in the form of digging in more to applicants‚Äô backgrounds, social media history, ect. It also means a lot of the processing efficiencies the agency realized under Biden are starting to be disregard or cancelled entirely. Streamline Case Processing (SCP) is an automated adjudication process used on I-90 and I-765s mostly and allows for cases to be adjudicated without any intervention by an officer, if that case passes a checklist built out to determine eligibility. To give an idea of the impact and success of this process, in fiscal year 2024, the NBC was able to adjudicate roughly half of their I-765 receipts through this process. It did the equivalent work of almost 80 officers! One of the first directives of the new political leadership of the agency was to turn off this automated processing for several months. It‚Äôs reportedly restarted SCP, but with additional vetting enhancements resulting in fewer cases making it through the various workflows. And this is what they want; not efficiency or improvement, but roadblocks disguised as ‚Äúenhanced vetting.‚Äù ¬†¬†\n\nLooking ahead now to the coming years, USCIS will likely be under immense pressure to continue supporting ICE and the admin‚Äôs deportation machine, all the while its pending case counts continue to grow. That means more USCIS employees detailed out to ICE and CBP and more time spent by officers on ‚Äúvetting‚Äù that adds no benefit to the adjudication process. Hundreds of new Special Agent positions with law enforcement powers have been announced; where the funding for these positions comes from is a question mark (e.g. from applicant fees?). There‚Äôs a chance backlogs may not get as bad as they were in the past, solely because we may be seeing much lower levels of immigration. There also will be continued policy changes aimed at slowing down or eliminating entirely certain benefit categories. Work authorization is one area where this admin is focusing on with the goal of making otherwise eligible applicants lose their work authorization in the hopes they self-deport. De-naturalization will likely be another top priority for the agency. This process involves a huge amount of time and resources that will need to be diverted away from adjudication. The last time the agency stood up this type of task force, there were dozens of highly paid and experienced officers (GS13 pay grade and above) working full-time on this; this time it will likely be an even larger effort. ¬†\n\nFinally, what does all of this mean for those of you trying to ‚Äúcome the right way‚Äù and those of us whose job is to help you do that? Delay, confusion, and inconsistency. This needs to be said in absolute, crystal-clear terms: this administration wants as little legal immigration as possible. They know they cannot completely stop immigration, so they instead will focus on making it as expensive, slow, and miserable for people as they can. I promise you that what gets reported in the news, be it a new policy or requirement, is just a small sampling of the ways this administration is telling the agency to make things more difficult and/or slower.¬†\n\nMy best advice for anyone submitting anything to USCIS: Quality over Quantity. Present your strongest evidence prominently and make sure it is done in a clear and concise manner. Former USCIS Director Jaddou made this point this past Spring shortly after leaving during a round table discussion with AILA. Look at your filing through the eyes of stressed, overworked, and de-moralized officer. Is everything submitted easy to find, to understand, to clearly show you are eligible for the benefit sought? Is it easy for that officer to get to ‚Äúyes?‚Äù (Funny enough, USCIS director Edlow gave an interview saying he did not want officers to ‚Äúget to yes,‚Äù but he also did not ‚ÄúNECESSARILY want a ‚Äòget to no‚Äô either‚Äù which basically gives away the game of what he wants to agency to focus on).\n\nAnd a note on attorneys/representatives: the agency has always had difficulties in tracking and preventing fraud and misrepresentations from attorneys and those purporting to be attorneys. It would take YEARS in most cases for the agency to bring a case against a fraudulent attorney and now, with a shift in focus on removals, there‚Äôs even less attention paid to this increasingly common form of immigration fraud. The agency has said it wants to go after fraudulent attorneys, but to them, that means attorneys filing fraudulent (in their eyes) claims, not attorneys (or purported attorneys) defrauding clients. Two things every applicant should do if wanting to engage the services of someone purporting to be an attorney: 1) the person should disclose what jurisdiction they are licensed in and the applicant should check with that bar authority to confirm they are in fact licensed and in good standing. 2) Make sure the attorney actually has experience with the type of case you are seeking representation for. After tax law, immigration law is generally considered the most complex. An attorney holding themselves out to practice ‚Äúimmigration law‚Äù in general may not be the best to represent you in your specific matter. You wouldn‚Äôt want a removal defense specialist to file your Eb1A I-140 or a business immigration attorney to file your I-601A waiver, for example.\n\n¬†I do hope this post is helpful to some and if there‚Äôs any interest, I could see about doing some AMAs later on once I‚Äôm officially separated from the agency.", "subreddit": "USCIS", "comments_total": 80, "comments_pos": 38, "comments_neg": 10, "comments_neu": 32, "agree_hits": 3, "disagree_hits": 0, "support_index": 0.804}\n{"post_id": "1gt0583", "title": "Greened!

I was following this subreddit for so long and got help from all of you, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my experience here with USCIS over the past 9 years.\n\nI came to the US with an L1B visa through employment in 2016, and after few renewals, I got my Green Card in 2020.\n\n**Here is my timeline for the naturalization:**\n\nField Office: Buffalo, NY. (But my interview was in Syracuse, and the oath ceremony in Ithaca)\n\nJanuary 11, 2025 - We received your Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, and sent you a receipt notice.\n\nJuly 8, 2025 - We scheduled an interview for your Form N-400, Application for Naturalization.\n\nAugust 27, 2025 - We recommended that your Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, be approved. Your case was submitted for quality review.\n\nAugust 27, 2025 - Your Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, was placed in line for oath ceremony scheduling.\n\nAugust 27, 2025 - Oath Ceremony Notice Was Mailed\n\nSeptember 25, 2025 - Certificate Of Naturalization Was Issued\n\nMy biometrics were reused from my GC‚Äôs application.\n\n**Experience during the interview:**\n\nI arrived to the Syracuse USCIS office 30 min earlier than my scheduled time, I was let in, passed through security, then I was surprised the waiting room was almost empty, just a couple of people waiting. I did check-in at the counter/window, they asked for my Green Card and interview letter, then took me a picture and fingerprints. Then she handed me a ticket with a number on it.\n\nLess than 5 min later an officer came in and called my number, I went in to her office, Took the oath, sat, and we started.¬† She was very professional, nice, calm, smiling and just easy to talk to.\n\nWe started with the civics questions right away, I was asked the following:\n\n* What major event happened on September 11, 2001, in the United States?\n* Who is the Speaker of the House now?\n* Name the 2 branches of the Congress?\n* What age citizens can vote for president?\n* For how many years a US representative is elected for?\n* Who is the actual president of the US now?\n\nI answered correctly all of them and passed the civics test. She was confirming that my answers were correct after each response.\n\nIn the writing and reading test, I was asked to read:\n\n* Who can vote?\n\nAnd then she asked me to write:\n\n* Citizens can vote.\n\nShe again told me that I passed the civics, reading and writing tests, congratulating me.\n\nThen she went through my N-400 form confirming basic data like name, height etc.\n\nI asked her to adjust some information that has changed since my application in January.\n\nI also told her that I had a speeding ticket in 2023 that I paid in full, she said that‚Äôs ok and she didn‚Äôt even ask for any documentation.\n\nThen she asked few more questions on the have-you-ever, and Yes/No questions. She didn‚Äôt ask any definitions.\n\nAt the end she asked me to confirm the data changes in the tablet, which I did and signed.\n\nThen she asked me to confirm my personal data as it will be printed in the naturalization certificate, I signed.\n\nShe left the room, and came back with a paper.\n\nShe congratulated me, telling me that I was approved and that my Oath Ceremony is scheduled for September 25th in Ithaca at the courthouse, which is great as it is closer than Syracuse from where I live.\n\nThe entire process door-to-door took about 20 to 25 minutes, I left before my actual scheduled time for the interview.\n\n**Oath Ceremony experience:**\n\nThe ceremony was scheduled at 10am, I arrived with my wife early on to avoid any last minute issue as I was skeptical to miss it due to a flat tire or anything.¬†\n\nWe were let in at 10am inside the courtroom, I handed the filled form and my GC and EAD.\n\nThe ceremony started at 11am, with a speech from the judge and the city representative, it was very emotional and nice, it made us feel part of this great country.\n\nWe pled the oath of allegiance repeating after the judge.\n\nWe also pled allegiance to the flag.\n\nThen they handed us the naturalization certificates calling us one by one, and naming our country of origin.\n\nThey had a band playing live music, which was nice. They also had snacks.\n\nI registered to vote right there. And we were offered to apply for a passport in the same building, they also gave us a pass to get free passport photo.\n\nI dressed suit and tie, with a US flag pin.\n\n**Other information and tips:**\n\nI took a LOT of documentation with me to the interview, like tax transcripts, speeding ticket payment proof, Bank statements, Credit report, employment letter, 4 GMC letters from colleagues and community friends, Lease proof for the last 5 years, etc.\n\nEverything nicely organized in a binder, and labeled.\n\nAt the end, I used none of it. ‚ÄúBetter have it and don‚Äôt need it, than need it and not have it‚Äù. I was skeptical after the GMC announcement from USCIS and started gathering every document I can.¬†\n\nI was also over-prepared for the civics and reading/writing questions.\n\nThis was one of the most important milestones in my life, so I dressed accordingly to the event. Please dress properly, no flip flops and shorts. It shows the officer that you are not taking this interview seriously.\n\nI travelled a lot during the last 5 years, but never exceeding the continuous and physical presence requirements, and I was prepared to answer any questions about that but the officer didn‚Äôt ask anything related to that.\n\nAgain, if you are in the process of getting naturalized, I wish you the best of luck, you got this! Please ask me any questions you might have.\n\nEDIT: Many of you asked about the link to get the naturalization certificate holder.

She didn't even go through the mountain of pictures that my Wife spent days compiling.  Wifey didnt find that part as amusing as I did. \n\nMy Wife and I were in a long distance relationship.  She lived in Coahuila Mexico her entire life.  She graduated from, what I understand to be, a prestigious University at nearly the top of her class with a degree in International Commerce.  She had a great career in the Automotive Industry.  If all that isn't enough, a loving and supportive family too.\n\nWe met, while each of us were on vacation, in Cancun back in 2014.  Kept in touch over the years making sure to say HBD to each other every year, since her bday is  just 7 days before mine.  She had her life and I had mine.  Actually, it wasnt until Jan 2023 that we actually started getting close.  Talked more and more each day.  Took turns flying to each other as much as possible, until I decided to propose at midnight on Christmas 2023.\n\nShe made the tough decision to leave her great life behind to start a life together in California. We were married in March of 2024 and two months later we found out we were pregnant.  She entered the US with a tourist visa and we were Married before her 6-month I-94 expired.  My understanding is that we had nothing to worry about.  \n\nFast forward to today.

I dont even want to blink because I swear that everytime I close my eyes, I can see the words, \"DEPART THE UNITED STATES WITHIN 33 DAYS.\"\n\nI know I'm probably grasping at straws here but the notice says that she doesn't qualify for adjustment under INA 245(a).  I'm reviewing the packet we submitted originally and, right at the top of our I-864, it reads 'Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA'.

We prepped for weeks ahead of time - came ready with all our documents, a photo album we made, newly collected ‚Äòevidence‚Äô, knew our forms back and front, etc. We sent our list to our lawyer ahead of time and she felt we were also prepared well. \n\nWe noticed an officer an hour or so before our appointment being rude to other applicants and hoped he wouldn‚Äôt be our agent (unfortunately, he was üò©).\n\nWe stepped into his office and he immediately brought a combative attitude. He asked for our licenses and told us ‚Äúeverything you hand me becomes evidence. What‚Äôs the problem here?‚Äù Our license addresses don‚Äôt match (totally something we tried to fix, so make sure you do!) because I wasn‚Äôt able to change it in the time before our appointment. He moves on from this after a few minutes of berating us about them being different and asked to see both of our house keys. We had driven there together, so only brought one set. He said ‚Äúwrong answer‚Äù and would not allow any further explanation. \n\nThen he brought out an article (I didn‚Äôt see the source so not sure where it came from) that talked about how marriage fraud is on the rise and basically started accusing us no more than 5 minutes into our interview. (For context, were in a good faith marriage and have plenty of other evidence to prove so). He pointed at a bookshelf in his office with what he called ‚Äòhundreds of fraud cases‚Äô he‚Äôs dealing with that all had shared leases, bank accounts, wedding photos, etc. He continued on this tangent, saying over 600 marriages had been falsified according to some report (again no clue which one).\n\nAt this point, our lawyer stepped in and asked if he could remain on task - she mentioned her address isn‚Äôt current on her license and wondered how he would be able to tell two keys are exactly the same (and how he would be qualified to call that ‚Äòevidence‚Äô) and told him she thought he was off base and in his communication style, going out of line, especially throwing around the word fraud before doing his due diligence of checking our other evidence. This clearly irritated him - and he threatened to cancel the interview and have us come back another day. Our attorney requested his supervisor come so we could continue and he stepped out to get her.\n\nThe supervisor was nice and said the interview would get back on track but when he came back in he once again tried to go back to the discussion about keys/marriage fraud. So our attorney reminded him to move on and he jumped to the I-485, of which he only asked me 7 questions (if I had ever been a prostitute, sold drugs, been part of a gang, been arrested, been in the army, or killed somebody).\n\nHe then collected what evidence we brought (no explanations, just had to hand it over and have him scan). Some evidence he attempted to reject because ‚Äòhis scanner wouldn‚Äôt read it‚Äô without even trying (our lawyer called him out on this so he ended up taking more than he wanted to). The photo album we made he quickly looked through but then told us he only wanted photos from after marriage (we included pictures from all the way back on our first date to present) so he took no photos. \n\nHe then gave us a continuation letter giving them 120 days to make a decision, request more evidence, or request another interview.\n\nWith stories me and my wife had heard lately, we both thought we‚Äôd be fine and it‚Äôd be an easy enough process with the right documents in place. We did notice every other couple besides us who had an appointment while we waited for the 2+ hours there got called in separately and we were the only ones called together - so not sure if that means we had a weaker case in their eyes or a stronger one.\n\nEither way, we‚Äôre now playing the waiting game.

It‚Äôs a moment that brings a mix of emotions: gratitude, relief, and an overwhelming sense of responsibility.\n\nFor years, I‚Äôve worked hard, faced uncertainty, and navigated a complex process, all with the hope of building a future in this country. The United States has given me opportunities to grow, to contribute, and to dream bigger than I ever imagined. And now, as a permanent resident, I feel an even deeper commitment to giving back to the place that has given me so much.\n\nEDIT: *to highlight domain-specific struggle(s)*\n\nI came here with nothing but ambition, driven by a passion for research and a hunger to contribute meaningfully to the scientific community. But let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîchoosing the path of a research scholar is not for the faint of heart. The road is steep, filled with grant rejections, funding uncertainties, and the constant pressure to prove your worth. Balancing research, teaching, and securing financial stability while being on temporary visas was an exhausting mental and emotional marathon.\n\nThere were days I questioned everything‚Äîwhether I‚Äôd ever have the security to call this place home, whether my work would ever be seen as valuable enough to earn me a permanent place here. The reality of academia is that even when you‚Äôre passionate about your work, the system often makes you feel disposable. Yet, I kept pushing forward, driven by the belief that knowledge should outlast uncertainty.\n\nI‚Äôve worked through sleepless nights, lived paycheck to paycheck, and endured the anxiety of visa renewals that determined my ability to stay. I navigated the complexity of bureaucracy while trying to push the boundaries of my research. Every fellowship, every publication, every small win was a step forward‚Äînot just for me, but for the contributions I hoped to make to my field.\n\nThis journey hasn‚Äôt been mine alone. I owe so much to my family, friends, mentors, and even strangers who have shown kindness along the way. Whether it was words of encouragement, guidance through bureaucracy, or simply sharing their own experiences, every bit of support has meant the world to me.\n\nI know this status is not just a privilege but a responsibility‚Äîto uphold the values of hard work, respect, and community. To anyone still navigating their own immigration journey, I see you. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs worth it. Keep going.\n\nFor many, this milestone might just seem like a bureaucratic process, another legal status update. But for me, it represents years of sacrifice, resilience, and an unshakable belief that the pursuit of knowledge and innovation is worth the struggle.\n\nToday, I‚Äôm celebrating quietly, taking it all in. But tomorrow, the work continues‚Äîbecause making a life here is about more than just a piece of paper. It‚Äôs about making a difference.\n\nThank you, America.

Interview itself (6 civic test questions, 1 writing question, 1 reading question, N400 questions, spouse questions, reading through the information on the screen, signing a couple times, waiting for her to print the decision) probably took about 15 minutes. I was told that I passed everything and to wait in a different area of the waiting room for the oath ceremony. Waiting for the ceremony to start, the ceremony itself, and then registering to vote right after the ceremony ended (this was all still in the same building) took longer than the interview itself, but I was very happy and grateful to wait for everything.\n\nThe only resources I used were the flashcards on the USCIS N400 site, as well as the list of questions also on that site, and the Citizenship with Jackie YouTube channel that I saw someone else in this subReddit recommend. I played several of her videos at two times speed, took all of her suggestions about the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts during the N400 interview, and her suggestions on the easiest answers to remember.\n\nAlthough family members were allowed inside the building, they were not allowed to go inside the separate room for the actual oath ceremony. The regular welcome packets are also no longer given out (idk if this is a national thing or local, or since when this has been happening), and instead we were all given 1 sheet of paper each with information about the next steps like a passport, Social Security record, and replacement fee if we lose our certificate. We were all given little gifts if we registered to vote before exiting: green string backpack, a white hat, a sticker, a black pen/stylus, and a stress ball, all of which have some sort of voting design on them. \n\nI have not been sleeping well for the past week from all the stress of‚Ä¶ everything (3-5 hours of interrupted sleep per night), so to finally be able to say that I‚Äôm a citizen feels surreal but also like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I truly hope everyone that is still waiting gets a positive answer very soon, and that you get your certificates of naturalization. üá∫üá∏ \n\nEdit: for everyone asking, Hialeah field office is where the interview, oath ceremony, and voting registration took place. Unfortunately, because my heart was pounding, and I was trying to control the nervousness in my voice, and hyperfocus on her questions so I can answer correctly and confidently, I immediately forgot the civic questions that she asked me as soon as we got to the reading and writing portion of the interview üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ I considered the civic test portion as the only difficult portion because I haven‚Äôt had to study similar material since middle school. Some of that information has changed since middle school anyway, like state senator, house representative, governor, chief justice, and speaker of the house.

Don't rely on getting a reminder\n\n**Extension (FO San Antonio TX)**  \nOctober 2023 - Reminder to send I-751 (Petition to remove conditions on residence / GC extension)\n\n>I did this whole process without lawyer, it was fine but it was still way more than I thought it would be at first. They ask for a lot of paper so make sure you have a lot of accounts, documents, letters, etc with both your names on it (if GC was marriage based). For example we had no utilty bills with both our names on it because I was the one taking care of it and I never thought to put my wifes name on there.\n\nDecember 2023 - I-751 sent\n\n>they were able to reuse my biometrics at this point\n\nDecember 2023 - \"temporary\" greencard recieved.\n\n>ok so this basically is a piece of paper that works as an extension. Put it somewhere safe, it is your new greencard but it's a piece of paper... I-751 takes almost 2 years until someone looks at it normally. (except in my case where I applied for naturalization before)\n\n**Naturalization (FO Greer SC)**  \nFebruary 2025 - N400 sent\n\n>Take a good look at the requirements for Naturalization, I had just moved states and almost sent my N400 too early (you need to wait 3 months when moving states).  \nAlso no need of biometrics for this one\n\nFebruary 2025 - Interview invitation (yeah that was quick)\n\n>Just learn for those 100 questions, also they ask you to bring every piece of paper they ever sent you. And just bring with you whatever they say to bring on the invitation. It's not that complicated\n\nApril 2025 - Interview. Interview went well, they spent a lot of time on my I-751 and then N-400 went really quickly.

I got my greencard in 3.5 months!\n\nPD 4/25/2025\nBiometrics reuse notice 4/30\nInterview scheduled notice 6/24 \nInterview 8/5 NYC FO, verbal approval\nOfficial approval 8/6 for I-130 and I-485\nI-765 denied 8/12 because ‚Äúreceived status through other means‚Äù\nGreencard delivered 8/14\n\nFor joint evidence, we submitted health insurance, 40+ photos, car insurance/lease/registration, house lease (3 yrs), utility bill, upcoming flight, marriage certificate. We used a lawyer. \n\nFor the interview, we practiced as if we would go in for a stokes interview/be separated. I was worried because our driver‚Äôs licenses don‚Äôt match (different states) and hearing about some bad interviews. We were lucky and had a very nice officer who seemed as if she had already decided to approve us and the interview was just a formality. No questions about our relationship at all. I was only asked ~5 of the I-485 yes/no questions. \n\nSince learning about my status as a teen I have felt so helpless and sad, constantly being in limbo and the monkey in the middle of politics. I finally feel like I can breathe. For anyone out there reading this, I am sending you love and crossing my fingers that you will feel this same sigh of relief very soon!

It wasn‚Äôt lies, just poor delivery and nervous confusion. Ugh.\n\nThe officer was firm and kinda rude, but still professional.

Like when we‚Äôll hear back or if he needed more docs?\n\nNow I‚Äôm spiraling ‚Äî wondering if our nerves and his awkward answers made us look suspicious.\nIt‚Äôs a real marriage, a good one. We live together, love each other, share everything. But damn, my husband needs a crash course in staying calm under pressure.\n\nAnyway, no approval on the spot.

There, we created or updated our USCIS accounts, uploaded essential documents like our Green Card and Driver‚Äôs License, and answered questions about our addresses, jobs, and education‚Äîsimilar to the green card application process. At this stage, the application remained in draft form, and we used our own phones to complete it.\n\nDuring the second week, we received our N-426 Certification of Military or Naval Service, signed by the BMT commander. This document is key to the citizenship process. Once we uploaded it, we finalized and submitted our application. The liaison ensured the application was expedited for faster processing.\n\nIn the third week, we completed biometrics. Since I had already done mine for my I-485 application, I didn‚Äôt need to repeat it, but others did. It was the same process as before. From that point on, all that was left was the interview, civics test, and oath ceremony.\n\nWe were given study materials for the 100-question civics test, which was straightforward, and everyone passed.

Technically I could've applied for n-400 in 2020 since I had the absence my time was resetted so I had to calculate from may 2020.\n\nDuring the interview they asked alot about my absence and I asked my i-131 approvals good thing I had everything in handy. When the officer noticed 4 year absence officer's mood changed a bit. But then again since I had pretty much all the evidence i was okay and I think it has happened beyond my 5 years of wait time they were okay I think.\n\nFirst the officer asked me civics questions I answered 6 correctly then she shopped and asked me to write \"California has the most people\". Finally asked couple questions regarding my basic information address marital status height. Then officer asked if they approve if I'd be okay for a same day oat ceremony and officer stepped out. I believe I was the last one to do the interview I said yes I wasn't expecting a same day since they called to the interview around 1:30 pm.. Officer was very nice and polite very thorough.\n\nAlso take a copy of your selective service you can get it from the selective service website\n\nFYI I had my lawyer with me also.

Ending birthright citizenship needs an constitutional amendment not an executive order unlike what he run his mouth with. For de-naturalization, do you guys not understand how incredibly difficult it is to de-naturalize a citizen? There is a list on Wikipedia about every citizen that has been de-naturalized and most of them is Nazi during WW2 with a few of them being recent time immigrants that committed major crime or fraud BEFORE they acquire citizenship. Plus, on top of that, Trump has NEVER mentioned or said anything about the so called de-naturalization \n\n\nLastly, you all realized that the worst case scenario such as bypassing laws and constitutions to deport citizens that some of y‚Äôall mentioned, would likely lead to a civil war in the United States similar to Myanmar?

From what I‚Äôve gathered, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to apply for the waiver given 1. There is only 5 years left on the ban and 2. The current administration. When the ten years are up (or close to it) my husband and I will find a competent attorney and discuss what it might take for me to be able to visit the USA again and go from there. ***\n\nHas anyone ever had success with waiving the ten year ban?\n\nI am a Canadian citizen married to a US citizen. When I was 26 or so I moved to the US, but overstayed my visa during the process of applying for my green card (it took us a while to save money). I can‚Äôt remember how long I overstayed, maybe slightly over a year..?\n\nUnder the first trump administration I was denied green card (my attorney was shocked, as she was confident my overstay would be pardoned because we have a genuine marriage).\n\nI was denied in 2020 and got the ten year ban. They denied me claiming financial concerns, that I‚Äôd be a public ward. At the time my husband and I were both fairly young (20‚Äôs) and not financially established yet.\n\nI left in 2020 of my own accord to move back to Canada with him. We applied for his permanent residence, which he successfully got. He now has a great career making over 100k/a year and I will be completing my grad studies this year and becoming a licensed psychotherapist, which will afford us even more financial security. I say this because we are both much more established than when I was banned, and that was their apparent reason to deny me. It‚Äôs also our intention to buy a home in Canada very soon.\n\nWe have a lovely life in Canada, but I haven‚Äôt seen his side of the family since 2020. Every time he goes home, we‚Äôre stuck apart. We were obviously stupid back then and didn‚Äôt grasp the gravity of the situation, but we certainly do now.\n\nI‚Äôm wondering if anyone has had success waiving this ban? Any stories at all would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I understand that my denial was based on public charge concern.

In an effort to clarify things, I am making this post to explain the policy update and to centralize discussion. All outstanding threads on the subject will be locked and all new threads on the subject will be removed.\n\nOn August 1st, USCIS issued [Policy Memo PA-2025-12](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-manual-updates/20250801-FamilyBasedImmigrants.pdf).\n\nOf particular note is this bullet in the Policy Highlights:\n\n- Explains that USCIS may issue an [Notice to Appear] if the alien beneficiary is otherwise removable since a family-based immigrant visa petition accords no immigration status or relief from removal.\n\nThis is a summary of a new section in the [Policy Manual](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-b-chapter-5#S-C-3)\n\n\"If USCIS determines the alien beneficiary is removeable and amenable to removal from the United States USCIS may issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) placing the beneficiary in removal proceedings. Petitioners and alien beneficiaries should be aware that a family-based petition accords no immigration status nor does it bar removal.\"\n\nIt has always been true that an approved or pending I-130 does **not** in and of itself provide an immigration benefit. However, historically, USCIS has not used I-130 filings to find removable aliens to deport. The change is that they now will.\n\n**Who is not affected by this change**:\n\n1. Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary is outside the United States.\n2. Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary remains in status.\n3. Anyone who is filing an I-130 and an I-485 simultaneously.\n4. Anyone who *has already* filed an I-130 and an I-485 (even if not concurrently).\n5. Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary continues to have some sort of formal protection from deportation (e.g. DACA, TPS, Military Deferred Action or Parole In Place)\n6. Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary is already in removal proceedings. (they can't NTA you twice)\n\n**Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary is in the United States and does not fall into the above categories should be concerned.** This might include people such as:\n\n1. Beneficiaries who intend to seek an I-601A waiver to ultimately depart for consular processing.\n2. Beneficiaries who are waiting for the petitioner to naturalize before filing I-485 (e.g. out-of-status spouses of LPRs)\n3. Beneficiaries who are eligible to concurrently file I-485 but are not for some reason (We occasionally get posts from people on here who say they can't afford both forms at the same time. That's much more risky now)\n4. Beneficiaries who are grandfathered aliens eventually able to adjust through 245(i) but need their petition to become current before they can file I-485.\n5. Beneficiaries who have final orders of removal. While not explicitly stated, if USCIS is using I-130s to find aliens they can serve with NTAs, I don't see why they wouldn't use I-130s to find aliens already ordered deported.\n\nRemember, when you file an I-130 for a beneficiary in the United States you are effectively raising your hand and telling the government who this person is, where they are, and that their immigration history is worth looking at. If they are removable that just got more risky. Petitioners probably should not file I-130s for people who do not fall into one of the six unaffected categories above without legal advice.", "subreddit": "USCIS", "comments_total": 80, "comments_pos": 15, "comments_neg": 9, "comments_neu": 56, "agree_hits": 0, "disagree_hits": 0, "support_index": 0.625}\n{"post_id": "1nxmvlm", "title": "Thank God finally approved", "author": "u/well_limitless30", "score": 398, "num_comments": 198, "created": "2025-10-04T06:44:21+00:00", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1nxmvlm/thank_god_finally_approved/", "is_self": false, "image_urls": ["https://i.redd.it/7cyhejg1k1tf1.jpeg"], "selftext": "There was a time I carried so much worry in my heart.
