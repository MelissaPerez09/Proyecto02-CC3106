On June 12, 2025 my mom finally got her green card. I was able to get my mom her permanent residency card by enlisting in the military (Army National Guard). I swore into the ARNG on May 31st, 2024 so it's only been a year since I started this journey. During the I-485 interview, not much had to be said, the interviewer said that our case was pretty straightforward. When entering the building, we had to be checked like at an airport. After that I only had to show the desk clerk our interview notice and my mom's form of ID, as well as my CAC to verify the method in which how we got the GC interview notice. The interview lasted around 25 minutes or so and we were approved on the spot. So for anyone questioning whether joining the National Guard can fix their parents' undocumented status, yes, yes it can and very quickly too! My mom had no criminal charges and only trespassed once and remained in the USA for over 30 yrs. 💚🎉 It feels amazing when things work out and when you worked for it too! 💪🏼",USCIS

An immigration attorney perspective ",u/Honest-Grape-9352,2898,714,2024-11-07T02:01:16+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1glflxy/so_what_now_an_immigration_attorney_perspective/,True,[],"(Before I begin, I kindly ask that I not be DM'd for consultations. I am happy to provide firm or probono recommendations via DM, but nothing more). 

Hi all, 

Using a throwaway. I have been lurking here for a while without commenting anything, but I feel like I need to give my two cents given the amount of posts on this sub. Excuse any typos or grammatical errors. I am typing this while I am highly caffeinated and dealing with my own caseload. 

Fellow immigration attorneys, please correct me if I'm wrong on any points. If you're not a legal professional, I do not want to hear it. 

Finally, none of this is legal advice. Please always consult with an attorney before making any decisions on your specific case. 


**1. Will DACA be taken away?**

Remember, nothing can be guaranteed. Genuinely, no one knows what will happen. 

I will say that in my opinion, likely no-- the economy makes way too much money from DACA folks. I do believe that they will dangle it like a carrot to appease right-wing voters. Major corporations employ DACAmented folks. The SSN from work permits have allowed more tax revenue to come in. Too much is at stake. Legally, the legal arguments at the courts surrounding DACA involve constitutional rights, which themselves aren't going anywhere anytime soon. It's honestly just a topic that is often talked about, but hardly understood by many. 

**2. What about I-131F PIP?**

As of today (11/7), this has been revoked. 

**3. Will the mass deportations actually happen? Is it actually feasible?**

I want to put this into perspective. There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. Currently, DHS has about 92,000 officers, and ICE has about 21,000 officers. It is asinine to try to achieve this. 

Let's say it actually does begin and people are getting rounded up. Guess what? Not all undocumented folks are just undocumented-- many have TPS, pending asylum applications, pending T/U Visas, and work permits (see my point regarding #1). Unless a migrant has an expedited removal (not likely), DHS/ICE still needs to process each deportee, assign them A#s, and follow basic procedures. If they don't? That's a very easy way to reverse a deportation order. It's the equivalent of convicting someone of murder using a confession made under a very obvious 4/5th amendment violation. Slam dunk case. 

Oh, and you know who has to handle all of these deportation cases? Federal DHS attorneys. They're already overworked, and they tend to exercise discretion. If no discretion, the overworked ones tend to gloss over cases and provide weak arguments. Only major attention is paid to serious crimes. You'd be surprised the amount of times DHS attorneys have gotten my clients' names wrong or made procedurally embarrassing typos. 

**4. What about ICE roundups?**

They still happen. Still need to follow procedures. If not, lawsuits and lots of deportation reversals. 

**5. Will there be a plan to denaturalize? Is it actually feasible? What about birthright citizenship?**

See #1 and #3. 

**6. What is likely to happen coming January?**

IMO, the end of prosecutorial discretion in deportation proceedings will likely happen immediately. This means that DHS attorneys will have to prosecute all cases. However, see my point for #3. 

**7. What will happen to my pending USCIS case? What will USCIS do now?**

Varies. USCIS is highly understaffed right now, and the backlogs are ridiculous. My guess is that between now and December, there will be a push to try to get as many I-485/N400s adjudicated before January. This may result in fees increasing for future applications. 

**8. Should I try to file my [insert case here] with the USCIS?**

I cannot answer this. I highly recommend an attorney. Unless your case involves a complex immigration history (think border apprehensions, previous deportations, court hearings or USCIS interviews), probono organizations may be able to take your case. 

**9. Can greencards be taken away?**

Greencard refers to lawful permanent resident status (aka ""LPR""). LPR status is given under a plethora amount of reasons-- each have their own statutory and common law requirements. Yes, theonewhoshallnotbenamed definitely enacted policies that made obtaining these harder, but not impossible. Again though, to take an LPR status, the USCIS is required to issue a Notice of Intent to Rescind, and it would allow you to argue your case. 

Again, USCIS is backlogged. When backlogs continue, immigration attorneys threaten mandamus lawsuits. Who has to handle these? US Attorneys. Guess what they will try to do? Try to dismiss as quickly and easily as possible, bringing the process back to square one. What do lawyers hate (among many things)? Their success ratings going down. 

**10. I legit think that they're gonna throw the whole rulebook away and just try to remove DACA, deport people, and do whatever erratically.**

Then we'll cross that bridge if we get to it. IMO, I never underestimated THAT ONE and his team. They are strategic and play the irrational and ludicrous card very well. Do I think they actually want to achieve the above? Definitely. However, I don't think it will come from the White House necessarily. They'll try to slowly change the social and political atmosphere, beginning at home. 

This means that the revolution starts at home. It starts in how we educate ourselves and each other. It starts by breaking generational curses and preventing history from repeating itself. It means raising our children better. It means being in community. 

**11. I want to leave the US.**

I can't blame you. I cannot give any information on this, and this is beyond the scope of this subreddit. 

**12. So, what now?**

As naive as it is for me to say, I think good always wins. The right is banking on your apathy, despair, and helplessness. 

**13. I'm glad that this is all happening. We need stricter immigration laws.**

Why are you in this sub? Let me know when you've joined the Olympics though, because the amount of mental gymnastics you are doing to justify your ignorance should be enough to give you a gold medal. 


EDIT: WOW. Lots of questions. I promise to try to get to as many as I can. I am but a mere attorney trying to meet his billable hours and trying to comfort my immigrant parents at the same time. 


EDIT #2: I'm adding some extra points that might help cover the general theme of questions I've been getting: 



**A. What about Operation Wetback?**

Crackdowns and ICE sweeps are still happening. Furthermore, they gotta be processed still. This means that they need to be in detention centers while ICE gets the proper paperwork from the deportee's home country (or Mexico), set up transportation, and deport them. Yes, this includes if it's even in a sweep and go type of crackdown. 

I don't underestimate the vile nature of THAT ONE and what he wants to do, but I mention the facts as someone who is heavily involved in this legal work. 


**B. What will change with my [enter type of application]? Do you think orangeblob will change it?**

No law has changed. This includes statutory and common law. Your case will move forward as is unless told otherwise. 

In terms of likelihood-- again, look at #1 and #3. They can dangle the hateful rhetoric as a carrot to right-wingers all they want, but money talks the most.


**C. Will family petitions change? Employment?**

They didn't during 2017-2021. They very likely will not change here. Major corporations, especially tech ones, rely on employment-based petitions heavily. 


**D. Everyone said don't worry and things got worse years ago. I'm scared.**

This is exactly what they want you to feel. This is their goal. This is why I made my post. Let this fear and grief transmute into courage and motivation for a better world for all of us. Overall, it's not attorneys or people in fancy suits that make the most change. It's the community leaders, the librarians, the students, the homeless shelter managers, and the barbers that know the names of everyone on the block. Hope is not lost. 

**E. I came here the “right way,” so everyone should follow the law/it’s only “illegals” that have to worry/any other unoriginal variation**

DM me for resources on how to have better empathy. 


**EDIT #3 (FINAL EDIT).**

Few more frequently asked questions: 

**F. Why do you think there will be a push to adjudicate AOS/N400? Isn't USCIS understaffed?** 

It happened post election in 2016. Pragmatically, it was probably because USCIS was expecting a large influx of applications come 2017. They decided to increase the fees, but they needed to give proper notice and time for people to file AOS/N400. Thus, leading to a mass influx of applications. 

As for adjudication: N400s are the last hurdle for most folks, and they're generally not as difficult to adjudicate as other applications. It's another application officers can remove from their plate. Immediate relative based AOS or AOS based on current priority dates (without inadmissibility issues) are also generally easy to adjudicate. Yes, they are understaffed, but sometimes USCIS can shift focus briefly to some applications.

Will all of this happen come 2025? That's the hope. My naive side wants to believe that USCIS wants to make as many people residents and citizens as quickly as possible. There were a numerous amount of natz approvals in my firm right before the election. My guess is that they wanted people to vote.

Now, do I think CONSULAR ones will also get pushed? No clue. That didn’t happen 2017-2021. See Item G below. 

**G. What about I-130s with priority dates? What will happen now?**

This type of question is complex for several reasons. (1) I-130s are provided for all sorts of reasons, both family and employment based, (2) It depends on the type, the country, and the field office handling this case and (3) It also depends if consular processing will need to get involved. 

Right now, nothing has changed. This means that the priority dates on the visa bulletins are ones to look at. 

What a lot of immigration attorneys do is if there's a valid reason to expedite (most common being a family medical emergency back home), then they request it. If that doesn't work, a threat of a lawsuit sometimes helps. If not, then we file a mandamus. The key to doing all of this is for when the I-130 has been pending for longer than the processing times. Keep in mind that US Attorneys are not a fan of mandamus because they are contractually required to take these cases, so they try to dismiss as quickly as possible. This usually leads to the government agency making their decision on the case.  

Now, if consular processing is involved: Each consular office operates on their own timeline and their own procedures. They hardly post these procedures. Guatemala takes about 6 months, and Peru takes about 2 years. Some attorneys also threaten to involve the courts for delays here, but consulates are controlled by the Department of State, making this a bit more challenging. 

Now, the burning question: will the above change? Pragmatically, overrunning and delaying the above is a poor financial decision, and money talks. You don't wanna mess with the golden nuggets of massive corporations. Can it happen though? Yes. Orangeblob did make the process slower for folks, and yes RFEs were issued annoyingly often. However, there is always room for argument and litigation, so not all hope is lost. 

What about priority dates? Will they change? Priority dates vary on visa type, availability, and country of origin. There could be delays, yes. No certainty just yet. 

**H. What about [insert student or business related visa]?** 

I unfortunately do not have experience in this field of immigration law. I cannot give a proper educated answer. 

**I. What about asylum? Title 42?**

Too soon to tell. Asylum interviews are in a massive backlog at the moment. In 2018, when DV/gang based claims were slashed, many asylum offices tried to help by ""stalling"" their decisions. It put people in limbo, but there was at least no referrals to court or initiation of removal proceedings. Will that happen here? Maybe, but again, too soon to tell. 

**J. If ICE starts rounding people up, am I next? Can I get picked up? What if I have an upcoming court hearing? Will they deport me?**

There is generally a priority system for ICE. They tend to be: those with pending removal orders (especially if removal order was based on criminal conviction) or those convicted of deportable crimes. 

If you have a criminal conviction, do not freak out. Not all convictions are deportable ones. This is a specific legal definition that is too complicated for me to type out. If you were charged after 2010, you must be provided with full legal advice of any immigration consequences of a potential conviction. 

Having an upcoming court hearing (even via a CBP One appt) doesn't necessarily make you a priority. Some of those hearings may be for pending asylum cases and there are no crim issues. 

Even if you have a previous deportation order, there are still options and there are still ways to fight a deportation. 

If you're still scared about being on a priority, think of this: A cop is doing speed checks on a 65mph speed limit freeway. There are a lot of cars on the freeway. Who is he likely to go after? Someone going 67, 75, or 90? Someone with a pending removal order (especially due to a serious criminal conviction) is much higher up there. Remember, if you fall under this category, there are options and there are ways to protect you. 

**K. But what if [insert scary scenario]? These are all just legal protections, and he wants to get rid of all of this. He's a fascist.** 

Remember, they are banking on your anxiety and uncertainty. The need for certainty and comfort during turbulent times is human nature. What is also human nature is innovation, the quest for justice, and community. Even if the worst comes to light, you have so many folks who are on your side and ready to fight for you (not just attorneys). 

Here is another metaphor I like to use: In the show Supernatural, Lucifer knew that Sam was going to give consent to take over his body. He had the whole timeline planned, down to the smallest detail. You know what he underestimated? Sam's love for his brother, Dean. Sure, Lucifer could predict human behavior, but he could never outsmart it. I say this here as well: don't underestimate the love that people have for one another. (also, the first five seasons in Supernatural were the superior ones, and I will immediately block anyone who tells me otherwise).

**L. I messaged you requesting recommendations for nonprofit orgs and firms. When can I hear back?**

I will do what I can. I will most likely answer these questions over the weekend. Any specific legal questions, unless something urgently stands out to me, I will likely not be able to answer.

I am former military and served in Afghanistan. We filed her adjustment of status through an immigration lawyer and got a receipt date of December 16 2023. We were originally going to do the paperwork ourselves but the complexity of the process scared us into asking a lawyer for help. We had one for a few months in because one of the required documents got lost in the mail, but otherwise the case has proceeded normally.

Here is my rant:
The part of all this that I don't understand is the absolutely unjust processing times. The standard processing time for my type of case is 47 months...the standard time....I can't even ask them a question about the case until August 29, 2028? Look I get it, I've worked for government organizations, I know the pains of beaurocracy, but this is an inhuman way to treat people when you consider that all this time they are living in fear of deportation or not being able to safely see family and travel. If you don't have enough case workers, hire more....each case costs us thousands of dollars to submit, so I'm sure the money is there. I mean I guess I'm starting to understand the illegal immigration issue more now that I see how stupidly difficult it is to legally immigrate, and this is for a woman with a collage degree and history of working at an executive level in a nonprofit. I'm just very disappointed in my country, and I want to say sorry to everyone that has been suffering through this process for even longer than we have.

Edit: for anyone still interested, my wife just had her Green card approved yesterday. It was a long and trying process, we even had our i485 denied at one point due to USCIS error, but we're able to get it fixed with an i290b. I know seeing the news every day is hard for those who are immigrating, and it's almost impossible to avoid the spread of fear but i hope that you don't lose hope, and are able to keep fighting for a place in this country. There may be some here that won't accept you, but not all, and i for one am glad that this country is not a place with only one culture because i believe we can all learn from each other and hopefully one day learn to love our differences.

Sharing something that left me absolutely gut wrenched for a young woman today… I would assume everyone on this sub knows this!!! But, if someone is just starting out their process… NEVER, under any circumstance claim to be a US citizen until you **are**!!

I was checking in for my naturalization today and while standing in line, I overheard her talking to a man in the waiting room. She told him that the interviewer completely stopped the interview after asking “Have you ever claimed to be a US Citizen?” She said, “Yes, of course!” The officer apparently double checked, she answered to the affirmative. Interview concluded.

What makes matters worse is that neither this young woman nor the man she was talking to seemed to understand the gravity of what just happened… I swear that the color left my face, heat left my body, and my heart skipped a few beats for this poor woman.

Won't give some details because I don't want to give the officer any troubles.   
We(My husband, US born and I) arrived at the building 20 minutes early. Obviously neither of us knew what to do or where to go once we got to the building. I wouldn't say the security guards were ""nice or friendly"" but they were helpful and didn't have any bad attitude. 

After waited a little over one hour in the waiting area, an officer called us in to the office. Once we got to the officer's office, I handed over my documents. The officer glanced over some of them, then said ""so tell me how did you two meet? Let's start with you (my husband)"". After he barely walked over 1 minute, that the officer said ""I've heard enough, congratulations your case is approved."" Mind you, we have barely spent 5 minutes total by this point. The officer still had to do some case updates so we spent 20-25 minutes in the office total. Meanwhile we were talking about TV shows, movies, and other stuff. We all forgot we were at a GC interview for the whole entire time. I know I am very very lucky to have this officer. The officer even said how he didn't like the current administration so maybe it has more to do with that. ",USCIS

 I’ve worked relentlessly to be here. I know I’ve earned this, and I'm proud, but I also have mixed feelings. 

I can't ignore the bitter undercurrent: the fear, the uncertainty. but maybe that’s exactly why this still matters.

What’s more American than showing up, using my freedom of speech and being a tiny part of helping push this country to live up to its promises and potential? What’s more patriotic than holding space for discomfort, demanding better, and fighting for the life you’ve worked hard to build, not just for yourself, but for others like you?

I walked into this ceremony with gratitude in my chest and a little grief in my heart. I’m not naive to what’s broken, but I’m also not backing down from what’s possible. Good people exist. I’ve met them, so many of them have made it all worth it.

This, along with the IRS not processing my 2022 taxes, me getting laid off in 2023 and being out of work for 5 months, not having many documents showing we share financial assets (cars are in my name, bills are in my name, and we live month to month), and her accidentally violating her visa made us think our interview was going to be a long, grueling, drawn-out process.

For weeks, we were studying every chance we got, trying to prepare for the tough questions and the intimidation tactics we thought they’d use on us.

But our interview was NOTHING like we anticipated.

We went in on 7/3 and were there for no more than 5 minutes tops. The officer was super nice, soft-spoken, and understanding. All they did was fingerprint her, ask if she had ever been in any clubs in her original country or done any military service, and then he said, “You’re approved.”

My face must’ve looked so dumb because right after that he smiled and said, “Yeah, I know… anticlimactic, right?”

I was so stunned that as we were leaving, I was low-key looking around for ICE agents to grab my wife for whatever reason lol. 

On 7/6 her case showed “approved” online. And around 12 AM on 7/10 it updated to say her green card was being sent.

1ngsxsx,Some Thoughts on USCIS From A (Soon-To-Be) Former Officer and Supervisor,u/WatkinsImmigration,1254,249,2025-09-14T14:37:38+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1ngsxsx/some_thoughts_on_uscis_from_a_soontobe_former/,True,[],"TL;DR: An understaffed and demoralized USCIS being turned into another immigration enforcement arm means more delays, denials, and inconsistent adjudication.

 My background: I came to USCIS as a burnt-out attorney in 2015 and I’ve been with USCIS just over 10 years; the first 7 as an officer (ISO) and the last 3 as a supervisor (SISO). I started with the National Benefits Center (NBC) in Lee’s Summit, MO in 2015 and initially, I mostly adjudicated family based (FB) adjustment of status (AOS) applications and associated ones like I-765 and I-131. I also worked or had experience with I-290b, I-360 SIJ, I-140 EB1A and B, employment based (EB) AOS, and a whole lot of customer service positions (congressional liaison, USCIS HQ contact, SRMT team). My last few years as a supervisor were spent as the main point of contact (POC) for parole-based work permits (I-765 C11s). I would love to write up a separate post on that experience sometime.

In April of this year, USCIS offered up a deferred resignation program (DRP), basically a copy of the infamous “Fork” offer DOGE and those clowns offered up to most of the federal government in Feb. USCIS exempted itself from the original DRP, but decided to offer it up along with early retirement and cash buyout payments. I was already planning on leaving the agency for a variety of reasons but decided to take advantage of this offer and was placed on paid, administrative leave 5/4/25 and will officially be separated on 10/4/25. At that point, I’ll be back practicing immigration law and doing my best to continue helping people navigate our purposedly complicated immigration system.  

With that introduction out of the way, I’d like to offer some thoughts on USCIS as it is now, and maybe more importantly, where it’s headed over the next few years and what all of it means for applicants. There are also a lot of current and former USCIS employees lurking here including some former colleagues, and they may have a different viewpoint than me on some things. So this is just me talking in my personal capacity, not on behalf of the agency or other employees of the agency.  

USCIS, like any large organization, can only complete its mission when it has a skilled, motivated, and engaged workforce. It’s taken a huge hit to all three of these since Trump 2.0 came into office. Many of the best and brightest throughout the agency left; I believe it’s been between 2,500 and 3,000 departures since 1/20/25. This represents around a 10% reduction in the agency’s headcount. A lot of the people who left had decades of experience and/or skills and abilities not likely to be replaced easily. The employees left behind are now overworked, stressed, and unmotivated due to draconian workplace changes such as RTO and flexible schedules eliminated (USCIS had successfully and broadly implemented telework since the early 2010s). We’re talking about cramming officers who’ve worked successfully for years at home into conference and breakrooms with only their laptops. A hiring freeze affecting most positions in the agency also means most open positions are not, and will not for some time, be filled. The Agency terminated the collective bargaining agreement with the Union in August, another major blow to what was left of morale. There are still many great people left at USCIS, people who want to do their best and will continue to do their jobs effectively no matter how hard this admin makes it. There are still strong leaders left who continue to work hard for their employees and the applicants who pay their salaries. But it’s not an exaggeration to say that morale is at rock bottom and there doesn’t appear to be much hope for improvement at this point in time.

USCIS went from a low point in morale in the summer of 2020 (Trump 1.0 with new USICS Dir. Joe Edlow then serving as de facto acting director) with a hiring freeze and proposed 70% employee furlough, to a high point in 2024 (generous admin leave given by Sec Mayorkas and record bonuses/time off awards, a director who actually cared and engaged with employees), and now back again to a new low in morale. It’s certainly possible some ISOs may be happier now; some field office ISOs may never have teleworked and/or enjoy issuing NTAs more now. But I think for the vast majority of agency employees, it’s now become just another job. They are villainized by their own leadership (Sec Noem on down), any work/life balance taken away, and being made to do additional work that doesn’t help them, the American people, or their applicants. There’s a reason why the government wide employee satisfaction (FEVS) survey was suspended this year!    

Policy-wise, USCIS has been abruptly shifted from its true purpose and mission of adjudicating immigration benefit requests to an enforcement support arm for which it has no congressional mandate and to be blunt, no desire for as well. This means more vetting in the form of digging in more to applicants’ backgrounds, social media history, ect. It also means a lot of the processing efficiencies the agency realized under Biden are starting to be disregard or cancelled entirely. Streamline Case Processing (SCP) is an automated adjudication process used on I-90 and I-765s mostly and allows for cases to be adjudicated without any intervention by an officer, if that case passes a checklist built out to determine eligibility. To give an idea of the impact and success of this process, in fiscal year 2024, the NBC was able to adjudicate roughly half of their I-765 receipts through this process. It did the equivalent work of almost 80 officers! One of the first directives of the new political leadership of the agency was to turn off this automated processing for several months. It’s reportedly restarted SCP, but with additional vetting enhancements resulting in fewer cases making it through the various workflows. And this is what they want; not efficiency or improvement, but roadblocks disguised as “enhanced vetting.”   

Looking ahead now to the coming years, USCIS will likely be under immense pressure to continue supporting ICE and the admin’s deportation machine, all the while its pending case counts continue to grow. That means more USCIS employees detailed out to ICE and CBP and more time spent by officers on “vetting” that adds no benefit to the adjudication process. Hundreds of new Special Agent positions with law enforcement powers have been announced; where the funding for these positions comes from is a question mark (e.g. from applicant fees?). There’s a chance backlogs may not get as bad as they were in the past, solely because we may be seeing much lower levels of immigration. There also will be continued policy changes aimed at slowing down or eliminating entirely certain benefit categories. Work authorization is one area where this admin is focusing on with the goal of making otherwise eligible applicants lose their work authorization in the hopes they self-deport. De-naturalization will likely be another top priority for the agency. This process involves a huge amount of time and resources that will need to be diverted away from adjudication. The last time the agency stood up this type of task force, there were dozens of highly paid and experienced officers (GS13 pay grade and above) working full-time on this; this time it will likely be an even larger effort.  

Finally, what does all of this mean for those of you trying to “come the right way” and those of us whose job is to help you do that? Delay, confusion, and inconsistency. This needs to be said in absolute, crystal-clear terms: this administration wants as little legal immigration as possible. They know they cannot completely stop immigration, so they instead will focus on making it as expensive, slow, and miserable for people as they can. I promise you that what gets reported in the news, be it a new policy or requirement, is just a small sampling of the ways this administration is telling the agency to make things more difficult and/or slower. 

My best advice for anyone submitting anything to USCIS: Quality over Quantity. Present your strongest evidence prominently and make sure it is done in a clear and concise manner. Former USCIS Director Jaddou made this point this past Spring shortly after leaving during a round table discussion with AILA. Look at your filing through the eyes of stressed, overworked, and de-moralized officer. Is everything submitted easy to find, to understand, to clearly show you are eligible for the benefit sought? Is it easy for that officer to get to “yes?” (Funny enough, USCIS director Edlow gave an interview saying he did not want officers to “get to yes,” but he also did not “NECESSARILY want a ‘get to no’ either” which basically gives away the game of what he wants to agency to focus on).

And a note on attorneys/representatives: the agency has always had difficulties in tracking and preventing fraud and misrepresentations from attorneys and those purporting to be attorneys. It would take YEARS in most cases for the agency to bring a case against a fraudulent attorney and now, with a shift in focus on removals, there’s even less attention paid to this increasingly common form of immigration fraud. The agency has said it wants to go after fraudulent attorneys, but to them, that means attorneys filing fraudulent (in their eyes) claims, not attorneys (or purported attorneys) defrauding clients. Two things every applicant should do if wanting to engage the services of someone purporting to be an attorney: 1) the person should disclose what jurisdiction they are licensed in and the applicant should check with that bar authority to confirm they are in fact licensed and in good standing. 2) Make sure the attorney actually has experience with the type of case you are seeking representation for. After tax law, immigration law is generally considered the most complex. An attorney holding themselves out to practice “immigration law” in general may not be the best to represent you in your specific matter. You wouldn’t want a removal defense specialist to file your Eb1A I-140 or a business immigration attorney to file your I-601A waiver, for example.

 I do hope this post is helpful to some and if there’s any interest, I could see about doing some AMAs later on once I’m officially separated from the agency.",USCIS

He has no criminal record entered the country with a tourist visa and has been married for 7 years to a lawful permanent resident. His I-130 was approved a few years ago and then he’s previous lawyer which is another story filed for the waiver (I-601A), he took fingerprints and that’s where the case was when detained.

Our lawyer just filed a bond motion, but we had originally sent documents to Texas before realizing that court didn’t have jurisdiction. since just today the EOIR system updated and showed the actual court (Three weeks after being detained).

What surprised us is that even though he’s physically in Texas now, his immigration case is still being handled in Massachusetts. So even though he’s been moved across the country, his hearing is virtually from Texas “if he is not transferred again” with a Massachusetts judge. We’re now just waiting for the bond hearing to be scheduled, he already has a master hearing for June which we are trying to expedite as well.

For those of you seeking asylum, waiting for interviews or decisions, hang in there. The majority of us doing these jobs are doing it for the right reasons. Most of us care about humanity.

I appreciate all the questions as well. However, I want to let everyone know, there are some questions I simply don’t know the answer to because immigration is a vast system and I work in a relatively small part of it. Also, there are other questions I’m just not allowed to answer because it would violate my oath and the ethics of my job. I will say this, as a piece of non-legal advice: no matter what benefit you’re applying for, no matter the reason you’re applying, just be honest. Just answer all questions as truthfully as possible. This seems so common sense, but it is fundamental to this process. 

Someone asked if I was worried about being doxxed or threatened. Someone else showed concern for my job. I want to say thank you for thinking of those things and for being concerned. The short answer is no, I’m not afraid. I say that because I do my job, I work very, very hard, and I follow the rules and laws of immigration. I am not afraid of someone trying to get me fired, because I can prove I work hard and I uphold my oath to the constitution. That being said, if there’s ever a question, I will fight like hell. I’m a disabled vet, we know what it means to fight for our rights and justify our existence. Plus, I’ve had someone trying to get me fired for years, from other agencies even, and they’ve failed consistently. Ha. But, again, it’s hard to fire someone who does their job.

They just don't like immigrants, maybe unless you're white European or [South African](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-orders-u-s-refugee-resettlement-of-afrikaners/). Those spots are just gone and they're not going to fill it with anyone else. This administration is also perfectly happy to let USCIS capacity wither with[ their hiring freeze and unreasonable RTO mandates](https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1ioo19h/comment/mcln804/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) so we're not going to see faster processing times.

You might say, ""I'm going through the process legally, I'm not like those illegal immigrants or TPS holders."" Right now they're starting with the low-hanging fruit. If you've been following what's going on, it should be a clear reminder to all that 1) many immigration benefits exist by executive fiat, 2) the White House exercises tremendous influence over how USCIS is run, and 3) this administration has a flagrant disregard for anything enshrined in the letter of the law as enacted by Congress or as [interpreted by the courts previously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark). Unless you're already a US citizen, we are all one executive order away from having our status challenged or jeopardized in various ways, if not outright revoked. I don't want to fearmonger but this is the reality that has been exposed.

So what can we do to support each other, especially if you cannot vote? You could talk to family and friends who can vote to educate them on misconceptions around immigration issues. If you're able to, please consider donating to immigration advocacy nonprofits. Otherwise, I think a little kindness and empathy toward others on their immigration journey goes a long way. Please keep in mind the reason the immigration system remains broken today is not because of other people in the line, but because of indifference/hostility of the general voting public.

I moved here under my my dad’s visa when I was 4 years old so the US has been my home for as long as I can remember. 
Long story: My parents got their citizenship a month after I turned 18 so I was basically on my own to make it happen. As you can imagine, at 18 as a super poor college student the 7 or 800 dollar fee to apply was a ton of money (twice my rent back then!) so it was on the back burner. I finally got to a place where that fee was not a big deal and you-know-who got elected in his first term and it scared me. I, of course, realize that I have privilege being caucasian but I was also arrested for petty theft as a bored teenager at 17 years old (tried as an adult in Texas) so I was advised to not seek it during that time. Fast forward to the new administration and BOOM covid and everything was at a standstill (including my greencard renewal which took forever). 
I finally got my interview in January, got approved on the spot and today was the day. It was a beautiful ceremony with almost 800 immigrants in an arts theater in downtown Oakland, CA coming form 79 different countries that were all individually recognized and applauded and cheered for.
I definitely got emotional several times because of how long this journey has been to just feel a part of the only country I have known as home.

I was following this subreddit for so long and got help from all of you, that’s why I’m sharing my experience here with USCIS over the past 9 years.

I came to the US with an L1B visa through employment in 2016, and after few renewals, I got my Green Card in 2020.

**Here is my timeline for the naturalization:**

Field Office: Buffalo, NY. (But my interview was in Syracuse, and the oath ceremony in Ithaca)

January 11, 2025 - We received your Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, and sent you a receipt notice.

July 8, 2025 - We scheduled an interview for your Form N-400, Application for Naturalization.

August 27, 2025 - We recommended that your Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, be approved. Your case was submitted for quality review.

August 27, 2025 - Your Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, was placed in line for oath ceremony scheduling.

August 27, 2025 - Oath Ceremony Notice Was Mailed

September 25, 2025 - Certificate Of Naturalization Was Issued

My biometrics were reused from my GC’s application.

**Experience during the interview:**

I arrived to the Syracuse USCIS office 30 min earlier than my scheduled time, I was let in, passed through security, then I was surprised the waiting room was almost empty, just a couple of people waiting. I did check-in at the counter/window, they asked for my Green Card and interview letter, then took me a picture and fingerprints. Then she handed me a ticket with a number on it.

Less than 5 min later an officer came in and called my number, I went in to her office, Took the oath, sat, and we started.  She was very professional, nice, calm, smiling and just easy to talk to.

We started with the civics questions right away, I was asked the following:

* What major event happened on September 11, 2001, in the United States?
* Who is the Speaker of the House now?
* Name the 2 branches of the Congress?
* What age citizens can vote for president?
* For how many years a US representative is elected for?
* Who is the actual president of the US now?

I answered correctly all of them and passed the civics test. She was confirming that my answers were correct after each response.

In the writing and reading test, I was asked to read:

* Who can vote?

And then she asked me to write:

* Citizens can vote.

She again told me that I passed the civics, reading and writing tests, congratulating me.

Then she went through my N-400 form confirming basic data like name, height etc.

I asked her to adjust some information that has changed since my application in January.

I also told her that I had a speeding ticket in 2023 that I paid in full, she said that’s ok and she didn’t even ask for any documentation.

Then she asked few more questions on the have-you-ever, and Yes/No questions. She didn’t ask any definitions.

At the end she asked me to confirm the data changes in the tablet, which I did and signed.

Then she asked me to confirm my personal data as it will be printed in the naturalization certificate, I signed.

She left the room, and came back with a paper.

She congratulated me, telling me that I was approved and that my Oath Ceremony is scheduled for September 25th in Ithaca at the courthouse, which is great as it is closer than Syracuse from where I live.

The entire process door-to-door took about 20 to 25 minutes, I left before my actual scheduled time for the interview.

**Oath Ceremony experience:**

The ceremony was scheduled at 10am, I arrived with my wife early on to avoid any last minute issue as I was skeptical to miss it due to a flat tire or anything. 

We were let in at 10am inside the courtroom, I handed the filled form and my GC and EAD.

The ceremony started at 11am, with a speech from the judge and the city representative, it was very emotional and nice, it made us feel part of this great country.

We pled the oath of allegiance repeating after the judge.

We also pled allegiance to the flag.

Then they handed us the naturalization certificates calling us one by one, and naming our country of origin.

They had a band playing live music, which was nice. They also had snacks.

I registered to vote right there. And we were offered to apply for a passport in the same building, they also gave us a pass to get free passport photo.

I dressed suit and tie, with a US flag pin.

**Other information and tips:**

I took a LOT of documentation with me to the interview, like tax transcripts, speeding ticket payment proof, Bank statements, Credit report, employment letter, 4 GMC letters from colleagues and community friends, Lease proof for the last 5 years, etc.

Everything nicely organized in a binder, and labeled.

At the end, I used none of it. “Better have it and don’t need it, than need it and not have it”. I was skeptical after the GMC announcement from USCIS and started gathering every document I can. 

I was also over-prepared for the civics and reading/writing questions.

This was one of the most important milestones in my life, so I dressed accordingly to the event. Please dress properly, no flip flops and shorts. It shows the officer that you are not taking this interview seriously.

I travelled a lot during the last 5 years, but never exceeding the continuous and physical presence requirements, and I was prepared to answer any questions about that but the officer didn’t ask anything related to that.

Again, if you are in the process of getting naturalized, I wish you the best of luck, you got this! Please ask me any questions you might have.

I had to go through security before my spouse and handover my forms, green card and EADs before heading upstairs to the ceremony. 

Tip for this office: use the bathroom on the first floor before heading upstairs to the naturalization ceremony room. 

The ceremony was well done and there were people from 20 countries out of 30 participants. We got a form to register for vote too, to be handed in after the ceremony.

There was a new video from President Trump - one of the guests booed before it played and nearly got removed from the ceremony! 

No photos in the ceremony room as they had another ceremony straight after ours but they set up flags in the building courtyard.

I don’t know the lingo too well bear with me. and if you have any negative comments save them to yourself. 

December 2022- my husband and I turned in our I-130 into USCIS 

for some insight my husband did have a prior deportation order from an asylum case that was turned down in 2018 

August 2024- request for evidence 

november 2024- your case is being reviewed 

february 2025- your case is being reviewed 

march 2025- your interview was scheduled 

now my interview experience: 
my interview was today at the Kendall FO in Miami, we went with an attorney and translator for my husband. (i’m a a USC) my attorney told us due to his order of deportation we had 3 possibilities 1. they approved our I-130 and we got out together 2. he would get approved and he would be detained and 3. he could get denied for whatever reason. 

well in regards to the interview, the officer spoke both english and spanish, he only asked us where we met, and how he proposed. he asked if we had any other evidence to give which I had plenty files of our taxes, bank accounts, car insurance, car registration, family affidavits etc. 

the officer gave us the approval for our i-130 then asked that I be escorted out (our 2 year old son was with us and we were both taken out of the room) 

a female officer escorted us to the waiting room, about 3 minutes after she came back out asking for my husbands phone which I gave her and 2 minutes later my attorney came out with my husband jewelry and told me he was detained. 

now, we have to submit a stay of removal at ice and if it is granted, my husband cannot be deported back to his home country and as of now I don’t know what’ll happen next. we were waiting for our I-130 approval to put in a motion to reopen his case and get his order of deportation removed. 


I saw a lot of people going into the appointments and not many coming out. I haven’t spoken to my husband but I want to know how many people were taken with him. these interviews are honestly to get people in their custody but unfortunately missing them would be worse. I am praying for everyone and wishing everyone luck with their cases. just wanted to share my experience. 



EDIT/UPDATE: 

many are asking about his asylum case. when I requested his FOIA I got all the court documents from every court date he had. my husband was 15 years old, he had a pro bono attorney who was terrible. the guy wouldn’t show up to court, he would send other attorneys with him that has no idea what was going on with his case. so many times that the judge noticed and actually got frustrated and told one of the substitute attorneys “I keep giving extensions but his attorney never shows, and this is a minor kid who needs proper representation” well obviously with shitty representation his asylum got denied. and there were documents of evidence that his attorney never submitted. so when they appealed there was NO case because of this shitty attorney and he was ordered removal.

My mother is even a voter registrar. In January of this year, she went to renew her drivers license, which was to expire in February. She brought with her a birth certificate, marriage license, Military ID, Social Security card, original naturalization certificate (with seal and photograph attached), expired passports (3), and proof of Texas residency. 

My mother was denied a drivers license renewal because USCIS could not verify my mother’s “eligibility for citizenship”, even though she’s been a citizen for over 50 years. My mother is in a constant state of fear that she’s going to be arrested and deported, leaving my 87 year old invalid dad alone. She had to renounce her German citizenship when she became an American, so if she’s deported, she’s not sure she can stay in Germany.  The idea that my mom could be deported is ridiculous but we cannot convince her otherwise. She is inconsolable. 

It is now March and nobody can tell her what this means or how to resolve this. A Congress member told her she needed an alien registration number, but she has one. It’s on her naturalization certificate. It’s been suggested that she travel to the nearest USCIS office, which is three hours away. This creates a hardship, as she is the sole caretaker for my father who is a bedridden disabled veteran. Since she’s provided every form of document in her possession, I’m not sure what a face to face meeting will accomplish. 

Please, does anyone have any advice?

It’s not just paperwork—it’s an emotional roller coaster that lasts for months, sometimes years. You stop feeling like a human and instead become just another case number, another file sitting in a queue with no clear timeline.

Your entire life gets put on hold. Dreams, plans, family, career—everything is stuck in limbo, waiting for a decision from an invisible system that moves at its own unpredictable pace. The uncertainty is brutal. You live in a gray area, constantly questioning what’s next, if there even is a “next.”

The stress is relentless. You check your case status obsessively, refreshing the page every five minutes, hoping for an update that never comes. You try to stay strong, but the anxiety eats away at you. Every day feels like a battle against an unknown force that holds your future in its hands.

And when you finally get approved—if you do—it’s not just joy. It’s exhaustion, relief, disbelief, and a flood of emotions all at once. You should be happy, but instead, you’re left with tears, processing all the pain it took to get here.

I first came to the U.S. 8 years ago and received my Green Card late last year through employment-based (EB1A). I’m an Indian citizen.

Today, I returned to the U.S. after a one-month vacation in India. Here’s how my interaction with the immigration officer went:

**Me:** Good morning, officer.  
**Officer:** Good morning.  
(I handed over my passport and Permanent Resident Card.)  
**Officer:** Are you a Permanent Resident?  
**Me:** Yes.

After about five seconds, he handed back my passport and Green Card — and that was it. Simple and smooth!

It has been over 3 months since our interview, an interview that actually went pretty well.  The Agent was nice, and she mentioned that our baby girl was evidence enough.  She didn't even go through the mountain of pictures that my Wife spent days compiling.  Wifey didnt find that part as amusing as I did. 

My Wife and I were in a long distance relationship.  She lived in Coahuila Mexico her entire life.  She graduated from, what I understand to be, a prestigious University at nearly the top of her class with a degree in International Commerce.  She had a great career in the Automotive Industry.  If all that isn't enough, a loving and supportive family too.

We met, while each of us were on vacation, in Cancun back in 2014.  Kept in touch over the years making sure to say HBD to each other every year, since her bday is  just 7 days before mine.  She had her life and I had mine.  Actually, it wasnt until Jan 2023 that we actually started getting close.  Talked more and more each day.  Took turns flying to each other as much as possible, until I decided to propose at midnight on Christmas 2023.

She made the tough decision to leave her great life behind to start a life together in California. We were married in March of 2024 and two months later we found out we were pregnant.  She entered the US with a tourist visa and we were Married before her 6-month I-94 expired.  My understanding is that we had nothing to worry about.  

Fast forward to today.  My Wife struggling to read the above denial notice, as she bawls her eyes out, while I hold our beautiful six-month old daughter in disbelief.  THIS HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.

I've been sitting here for hours trying to figure out what the hell happened.  I dont even want to blink because I swear that everytime I close my eyes, I can see the words, ""DEPART THE UNITED STATES WITHIN 33 DAYS.""

I know I'm probably grasping at straws here but the notice says that she doesn't qualify for adjustment under INA 245(a).  I'm reviewing the packet we submitted originally and, right at the top of our I-864, it reads 'Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA'.  In fact, I cant find any mention of INA 245(a) anywhere. Am I on the right track?  Would it be too much to ask for this to be a clerical error that can be easily fixed??  Anyway, sorry for the essay.  Thanks.",USCIS

01/23/2025: Attended my biometrics appointment, the entire process took about 10 minutes, I was the only person in the building. That same day I received a notification that USCIS was actively reviewing my case.

03/14/2025: Interview was scheduled.

03/23/2025: Attended my interview. The entire process, from entering the building to exiting, was probably about an hour, the interview itself was around 20 minutes and felt more like a conversation rather than an interview or interrogation. Please do study a lot though! 

04/21/2025: Oath Ceremony was scheduled.

05/16/2025: Attended Ceremony. In my case, the ceremony was about 15 minutes long. The process of entering the building and waiting for all the applicants and guests to arrive took longer. 

As an extra, I applied for my passport at my nearest post office on 05/20/2025 and received it today, 06/05/2025. Did not pay for expedited service. I haven’t received my documents but they have been sent.

Did it through marriage, it was simple and fast. The entire interview took about 20 min and then the oath ceremony on the same day. 

It was easy. I got an officer who was stern and wouldn’t let out any emotion. Started with checking my documents like passport, green card, then conducted civics test, written and reading test which were easy peasy. Since I did it through marriage, she looked through the pics I brought, documents like joint tax returns, bank statements for a few minutes. Then she typed something on her desktop for a little while and then said you’re approved , have a nice day. Took the oath ceremony an hour later. It was a very good smooth experience overall.  During the ceremony they played a video of Trump congratulating and welcoming the new citizens and everyone’s expression was cringe, that was funny lol",USCIS

PD: Aug 17 (N400), under 3 years rules, (VAWA applicants)

Dec 5: interview was scheduled 
January 21th: interview and oat

PO: Los Angeles

My appointment was at 1:45pm, i got through security at 1:10pm i was the only one in line. 
Went to the front window to check in, got my picture and finger print taken. The lady told me they're offering same day oat if i would like to have if i pass, i agree to it. Because that was exactly what i wanted since we don't know how things can change with the new administration if i want future date. ( i only 3min)

I sat down and i did not get call in until 2:16pm by the female officer ( Note: while i was seating down they did oat ceremony for some people at 1:40pm, i hear the lady telling some people to wait they oat is giving every hour) 

Once i got in with my conducting officer, we took a oat before my civics test (6 questions)

1. Name one branch or part of the government 
2. We elect a US senator for how many years 
3. In what month do we vote for the president 
4. Who is the chief Justice of united state now
5. Who did united state fight in world war ll
6. Name on US territory.

Reading: Where is the Capital of United State
Writing: The white house is in Washington DC 

After that was going through my application and making sure everything is up to date and no mistake in my name. 

She said congratulations, i will be approving you now so you can take a oat. We talk about me applying to become uscis officer but with the new administration i will have to wait until hiring is back on. ( i got notification like 10min later on my uscis website)

By 2:50pm we took our oat and i was out of the building by 3pm

PS: i did not drive there i took lyft since i heard it is hard to find parking in the area if construction is going on. I don't want to risk my stress level looking for parking before my interview. 

I hope someone find this helpful. GOD BLESS AMERICA 🇺🇸

My appointment was at 10:00 AM, so I showed up at Federal Plaza around 9:30. I was surprised right away ,no lines at security, not a single person in sight. When I got upstairs to the 8th floor, it was completely empty. The check-in windows were closed, and even the security guard looked confused. He asked, “What are you doing here?” and then told me the office was actually closed to the public today for a training day.

That’s when I started thinking maybe there was some mistake. The guard took my paper to double-check with USCIS officials, and they came back saying, “Yes, we’re expecting him.” Turns out… they had planned the oath just for me.

I was the only applicant in the entire building. The officers were incredibly nice and welcoming. They had actually called me on Monday offering a Friday oath date, but since I mentioned I was traveling soon, they moved it to Wednesday after talking with a supervisor. I just never imagined it would be a completely solo ceremony!

It took only about 10 minutes start to finish, and now… I’m officially a U.S. citizen! Feeling so proud and grateful. 🇺🇸

If you're wondering why its so fast and only took 63 days and why they were calling to schedule me an oath very fast they said because my application is military based so it gets expedited and priority processing ",USCIS

1mftr8d,Marriage Based Interview…went horribly,u/Ok_Persimmon_7192,650,281,2025-08-02T15:46:07+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1mftr8d/marriage_based_interviewwent_horribly/,True,[],"My wife and I had our interview yesterday at the LA USCIS office. We prepped for weeks ahead of time - came ready with all our documents, a photo album we made, newly collected ‘evidence’, knew our forms back and front, etc. We sent our list to our lawyer ahead of time and she felt we were also prepared well. 

We noticed an officer an hour or so before our appointment being rude to other applicants and hoped he wouldn’t be our agent (unfortunately, he was 😩).

We stepped into his office and he immediately brought a combative attitude. He asked for our licenses and told us “everything you hand me becomes evidence. What’s the problem here?” Our license addresses don’t match (totally something we tried to fix, so make sure you do!) because I wasn’t able to change it in the time before our appointment. He moves on from this after a few minutes of berating us about them being different and asked to see both of our house keys. We had driven there together, so only brought one set. He said “wrong answer” and would not allow any further explanation. 

Then he brought out an article (I didn’t see the source so not sure where it came from) that talked about how marriage fraud is on the rise and basically started accusing us no more than 5 minutes into our interview. (For context, were in a good faith marriage and have plenty of other evidence to prove so). He pointed at a bookshelf in his office with what he called ‘hundreds of fraud cases’ he’s dealing with that all had shared leases, bank accounts, wedding photos, etc. He continued on this tangent, saying over 600 marriages had been falsified according to some report (again no clue which one).

At this point, our lawyer stepped in and asked if he could remain on task - she mentioned her address isn’t current on her license and wondered how he would be able to tell two keys are exactly the same (and how he would be qualified to call that ‘evidence’) and told him she thought he was off base and in his communication style, going out of line, especially throwing around the word fraud before doing his due diligence of checking our other evidence. This clearly irritated him - and he threatened to cancel the interview and have us come back another day. Our attorney requested his supervisor come so we could continue and he stepped out to get her.

The supervisor was nice and said the interview would get back on track but when he came back in he once again tried to go back to the discussion about keys/marriage fraud. So our attorney reminded him to move on and he jumped to the I-485, of which he only asked me 7 questions (if I had ever been a prostitute, sold drugs, been part of a gang, been arrested, been in the army, or killed somebody).

He then collected what evidence we brought (no explanations, just had to hand it over and have him scan). Some evidence he attempted to reject because ‘his scanner wouldn’t read it’ without even trying (our lawyer called him out on this so he ended up taking more than he wanted to). The photo album we made he quickly looked through but then told us he only wanted photos from after marriage (we included pictures from all the way back on our first date to present) so he took no photos. 

He then gave us a continuation letter giving them 120 days to make a decision, request more evidence, or request another interview.

With stories me and my wife had heard lately, we both thought we’d be fine and it’d be an easy enough process with the right documents in place. We did notice every other couple besides us who had an appointment while we waited for the 2+ hours there got called in separately and we were the only ones called together - so not sure if that means we had a weaker case in their eyes or a stronger one.

Either way, we’re now playing the waiting game. If anyone has any experience like this or advice, would love to hear it. Making an appointment at the DMV as we speak 🤦 

Update: I got my approval of I485 and I130 couple days ago. I guess it was a little game of interviewer. Here is my timeline:
-Applied on April 11th
-Scheduled biometric appointment on April 18th
-Requested RFE on May 9th
-Scheduled interview on June 23rd (for August 1st)

Today marks a significant milestone in my journey—I am officially a permanent resident of the United States. It’s a moment that brings a mix of emotions: gratitude, relief, and an overwhelming sense of responsibility.

For years, I’ve worked hard, faced uncertainty, and navigated a complex process, all with the hope of building a future in this country. The United States has given me opportunities to grow, to contribute, and to dream bigger than I ever imagined. And now, as a permanent resident, I feel an even deeper commitment to giving back to the place that has given me so much.

EDIT: *to highlight domain-specific struggle(s)*

I came here with nothing but ambition, driven by a passion for research and a hunger to contribute meaningfully to the scientific community. But let’s be honest—choosing the path of a research scholar is not for the faint of heart. The road is steep, filled with grant rejections, funding uncertainties, and the constant pressure to prove your worth. Balancing research, teaching, and securing financial stability while being on temporary visas was an exhausting mental and emotional marathon.

There were days I questioned everything—whether I’d ever have the security to call this place home, whether my work would ever be seen as valuable enough to earn me a permanent place here. The reality of academia is that even when you’re passionate about your work, the system often makes you feel disposable. Yet, I kept pushing forward, driven by the belief that knowledge should outlast uncertainty.

I’ve worked through sleepless nights, lived paycheck to paycheck, and endured the anxiety of visa renewals that determined my ability to stay. I navigated the complexity of bureaucracy while trying to push the boundaries of my research. Every fellowship, every publication, every small win was a step forward—not just for me, but for the contributions I hoped to make to my field.

This journey hasn’t been mine alone. I owe so much to my family, friends, mentors, and even strangers who have shown kindness along the way. Whether it was words of encouragement, guidance through bureaucracy, or simply sharing their own experiences, every bit of support has meant the world to me.

I know this status is not just a privilege but a responsibility—to uphold the values of hard work, respect, and community. To anyone still navigating their own immigration journey, I see you. It’s not easy, but it’s worth it. Keep going.

For many, this milestone might just seem like a bureaucratic process, another legal status update. But for me, it represents years of sacrifice, resilience, and an unshakable belief that the pursuit of knowledge and innovation is worth the struggle.

Today, I’m celebrating quietly, taking it all in. But tomorrow, the work continues—because making a life here is about more than just a piece of paper. It’s about making a difference.

Thank you, America. Here’s to new beginnings. 🇺🇸

INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE:
Our interview was at 7:00 AM in Fort Lauderdale, and we arrived at 6:30 AM. We waited outside until they opened the doors and were the first ones called in. The officer was nice but serious.

The first thing he did was have us sign a paper stating that we would apply for the 10-year green card 90 days before the 2-year card expires. Then he asked for updated documents to prove that we’re still together.

We gave him about 30 new photos, our joint phone bill, and our joint bank account statement. After scanning the documents, he asked how we met. We told him we’ve known each other since we were kids. Then he asked about the proposal — we said it was more of an intimate conversation than a formal proposal, and that we plan to do something special like a trip in the future.

He looked at us and said, “Your relationship looks real to me,” and told us he would approve us. The whole thing took no more than 15 minutes.

July 2nd – Case was approved on the website

July 10th – Green card was produced

July 12th – Green card received

Wanted to share my timeline and some resources that I found to be very helpful. 

12/31/24 – USCIS received my N400 (I applied and submitted online) 

1/16/25 - interview was scheduled for 2/20/25

2/20/25 - arrived a little bit early to my appointment, maybe ~10 minutes early. Interview itself (6 civic test questions, 1 writing question, 1 reading question, N400 questions, spouse questions, reading through the information on the screen, signing a couple times, waiting for her to print the decision) probably took about 15 minutes. I was told that I passed everything and to wait in a different area of the waiting room for the oath ceremony. Waiting for the ceremony to start, the ceremony itself, and then registering to vote right after the ceremony ended (this was all still in the same building) took longer than the interview itself, but I was very happy and grateful to wait for everything.

The only resources I used were the flashcards on the USCIS N400 site, as well as the list of questions also on that site, and the Citizenship with Jackie YouTube channel that I saw someone else in this subReddit recommend. I played several of her videos at two times speed, took all of her suggestions about the do’s and don’ts during the N400 interview, and her suggestions on the easiest answers to remember.

Although family members were allowed inside the building, they were not allowed to go inside the separate room for the actual oath ceremony. The regular welcome packets are also no longer given out (idk if this is a national thing or local, or since when this has been happening), and instead we were all given 1 sheet of paper each with information about the next steps like a passport, Social Security record, and replacement fee if we lose our certificate. We were all given little gifts if we registered to vote before exiting: green string backpack, a white hat, a sticker, a black pen/stylus, and a stress ball, all of which have some sort of voting design on them. 

I have not been sleeping well for the past week from all the stress of… everything (3-5 hours of interrupted sleep per night), so to finally be able to say that I’m a citizen feels surreal but also like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I truly hope everyone that is still waiting gets a positive answer very soon, and that you get your certificates of naturalization. 🇺🇸 

Edit: for everyone asking, Hialeah field office is where the interview, oath ceremony, and voting registration took place. Unfortunately, because my heart was pounding, and I was trying to control the nervousness in my voice, and hyperfocus on her questions so I can answer correctly and confidently, I immediately forgot the civic questions that she asked me as soon as we got to the reading and writing portion of the interview 😅😅😅😅😅😅 I considered the civic test portion as the only difficult portion because I haven’t had to study similar material since middle school. Some of that information has changed since middle school anyway, like state senator, house representative, governor, chief justice, and speaker of the house. The interview happened in a very similar way to what was portrayed in the YouTube channel I recommended above, so I would highly recommend to go to her YouTube channel and watch several of her recent videos so that you can be more prepared. The more you know about what to expect, the better you can prepare yourself and increase your chances of a smooth interview.

This covers anyone applying for green cards, international students (of course they use the word ""foreign"") and any non-citizen affiliated with disfavored educational institutions - which could probably include professors and administrators

As we have seen with the F-1 visa/SEVIS terminations, this will very likely be AI/computer driven with very little regard to human discretion

But speaking of discretion, they're going to use disfavored social media activity as negative grounds to deny people immigration benefits

And to be very clear - if Trump were going after people who are ""pro-Semitic"" - a lot of the trolls' positions on ""free speech"" would probably change. Mine would not. As a lawyer and an American, I believe that freedom of speech, due process, and other Constitutional rights apply to all persons within the United States, not just Americans and not just for political positions that Trump likes or dislikes

>maybe before I start with the timeline my biggest tip would be: keep every single document you receive from uscis

Edit: Marriage based
March 2021 - Wedding

**Greencard (FO Honolulu HI):**  
March 2021 - sent in the application for I-485, I-130, I-765 and I-131

>Honestly here I don't know if 131 (Application for travel documents) was really necessary, I would have sent I-693 with it instead maybe (medical)

July 2021 - Biometrics appointment notice for August 2021

October 2021 - Recieved work and travel authorization (EAD)

December 2021 - Interview invitation for end of January 2021

January 2022 - Interview

January 2022 - Approval letter and Greencard in the mail

>At this point remember to write down in your calendar when to File I-751 (a bit less than 2 years after recieving your GC). Don't rely on getting a reminder

**Extension (FO San Antonio TX)**  
October 2023 - Reminder to send I-751 (Petition to remove conditions on residence / GC extension)

>I did this whole process without lawyer, it was fine but it was still way more than I thought it would be at first. They ask for a lot of paper so make sure you have a lot of accounts, documents, letters, etc with both your names on it (if GC was marriage based). For example we had no utilty bills with both our names on it because I was the one taking care of it and I never thought to put my wifes name on there.

December 2023 - I-751 sent

>they were able to reuse my biometrics at this point

December 2023 - ""temporary"" greencard recieved.

>ok so this basically is a piece of paper that works as an extension. Put it somewhere safe, it is your new greencard but it's a piece of paper... I-751 takes almost 2 years until someone looks at it normally. (except in my case where I applied for naturalization before)

**Naturalization (FO Greer SC)**  
February 2025 - N400 sent

>Take a good look at the requirements for Naturalization, I had just moved states and almost sent my N400 too early (you need to wait 3 months when moving states).  
Also no need of biometrics for this one

February 2025 - Interview invitation (yeah that was quick)

>Just learn for those 100 questions, also they ask you to bring every piece of paper they ever sent you. And just bring with you whatever they say to bring on the invitation. It's not that complicated

April 2025 - Interview. Interview went well, they spent a lot of time on my I-751 and then N-400 went really quickly. Recieved the Invitation for the ceremony at the end of the interview

April 2025 (5 days later) - Naturalization ceremony - 🇺🇸

End of April 2025 - Sent in my naturalization certificate via usps for passport

>Don't forget to sign the certificate and take a copy, I forgot to take a copy and when my employer wanted to get a copy I didn't have one. Wasn't a big deal but I just wished I had made a copy.

End of May - Recieved my passport in the mail

Early June - Recieved my naturalization certificate in the mail

Has this happened to anyone else? We thought passing the oral and written portion was enough demonstration of English speaking ability. Can the officers really fail you because they don't like how you talk/that you respond too slowly? This was at the Detroit office,  and he had to drive 3 hours for this. Thankfully he's got another chance in 3 months, though. Any comments/thoughts are appreciated, we're really confused on this, but my googling skills are failing me right now.

* **National Emergency Declaration**
   * Declares a national emergency on the southern border of the U.S.
   * Purpose: allocate military funds and resources to expand the border wall (more like a fence) and send troops to repel the supposed ""disastrous invasion"" of the country.
* **Cancellation of the CBP One App**
   * The app created by the Biden administration, used to schedule appointments with immigration officials for asylum requests, was shut down.
   * Migrants in various border cities in Mexico had their appointments canceled immediately after the presidential inauguration.
   * An estimated 280,000 people accessed the app daily.
* **Reinstatement of the ""Remain in Mexico"" Policy**
   * Requires asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed in U.S. immigration courts.
   * Initially implemented in 2019, it was criticized for exposing migrants to dangerous conditions in Mexico and was terminated by the Biden administration in 2021.
   * The practical implementation of this policy depends on the cooperation of the Mexican government.
* **Attempt to Revoke Birthright Citizenship**
   * Declares that children of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S. will not be recognized as citizens.
   * Contradicts the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
   * This measure is expected to be challenged in court quickly.
   * Relies on legal precedents like the 1898 case, *United States vs. Wong Kim Ark*, which reaffirmed birthright citizenship.
* **Designation of Drug Cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations**
   * Classifies drug cartels as terrorist organizations due to the nature of their criminal activities.
   * Imposes sanctions, legal restrictions, financial penalties, and travel bans on individuals or institutions associated with these cartels.
* **Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act**
   * A rarely used 1798 law was invoked to eliminate foreign gangs and criminal networks in the U.S.
   * Debate exists on whether the conditions for its application (declared war, invasion, or predatory incursion) are applicable in the current context.
* **Enforcement Operations**
   * No reports yet of large-scale removal operations or mass deportations.
   * Increased enforcement and removal operations are expected.",USCIS

Rant time. I had my marriage-based green card interview yesterday at Dallas office and I’m STILL stressed. My husband — God bless his heart — is the most nervous human on Earth. He freezes under pressure, and at the worst possible time, he became a confused mess. 🙃

The officer literally started the interview by asking, “Why is your husband so nervous? Nervousness usually means fraud. Is your marriage real?”
LIKE WHAT??? That’s how we kicked off! Not even a “hi.” I nearly passed out.

Then came a flood of personal questions:
	•	Why did you get divorced?
	•	When did you get married?
	•	When did your kids meet their stepmom?
	•	Where did you go for your honeymoon?
	•	Did you meet each other’s families?

Totally fair questions — I get it. But my dear husband was fumbling dates, mixing up timelines, and at one point looked at me for help like he forgot how calendars work. 😵‍💫

I held it together, answered confidently, but every time he opened his mouth I felt like screaming. It wasn’t lies, just poor delivery and nervous confusion. Ugh.

The officer was firm and kinda rude, but still professional. After wrapping up the I-485 questions, he just said, “Let me escort you out. Any questions for me?”
We said no… and now I’m wondering if we should’ve asked something? Like when we’ll hear back or if he needed more docs?

Now I’m spiraling — wondering if our nerves and his awkward answers made us look suspicious.
It’s a real marriage, a good one. We live together, love each other, share everything. But damn, my husband needs a crash course in staying calm under pressure.

Anyway, no approval on the spot. No “you’ll hear from us.” Just a walkout. I’m losing sleep thinking we blew it.

Anyone else been through this mess? How long till we hear back? Did we screw this up?

I know this will not get a lot of traction because it’s an “open and shut” case.

1ljqak7,After 26 years and 10 months… I think I’m finally American? 🇺🇸,u/Impatientlywaiting98,542,93,2025-06-24T23:23:09+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1ljqak7/after_26_years_and_10_months_i_think_im_finally/,False,['https://i.redd.it/8dl8gif9ly8f1.jpeg'],"Honestly, I’m still in shock. I didn’t think this day would ever come. Almost 27 years in the U.S., and today I became a citizen. I’m not even sure how to feel—grateful? Emotional? Still processing?

I was told for years (by multiple lawyers) that my only chance was through amnesty. See, I came here as a kid, and somewhere along the way, I lost my passport. No proof of entry. No clear path. Even though my parents eventually became citizens, they told me I was stuck. The lawyers said my proof was probably long gone—it was the 90s, after all.

But one day, kind of randomly, I decided to apply for my I-94. I didn’t even think it would go anywhere… but that’s when everything started to change. That moment opened the door I thought was permanently shut.

And today, sitting in that ceremony, I met a man who had been jailed, deported, banned for 10 years—he became a citizen too. After 15 years. Everyone in that room had a story. Some looked relieved, some looked overwhelmed, some were straight-up crying. And honestly? I get it now.

They told us to think of this as our second birthday. And… maybe they’re right.

Don’t give up. Even when it looks impossible.",USCIS

Yesterday I was greatful and thankful enough to become a US citizen!! 🇺🇸🙏🏼. I applied in may 29 2025 my FO is LA county. Interview was smooth I've been a Permanent resident since 2016 I had pretty big absence of 4 years since I was doing my studies in abroad. But I applied 2 i-131 travel documents in 2017 and 2019. Technically I could've applied for n-400 in 2020 since I had the absence my time was resetted so I had to calculate from may 2020.

During the interview they asked alot about my absence and I asked my i-131 approvals good thing I had everything in handy. When the officer noticed 4 year absence officer's mood changed a bit. But then again since I had pretty much all the evidence i was okay and I think it has happened beyond my 5 years of wait time they were okay I think.

First the officer asked me civics questions I answered 6 correctly then she shopped and asked me to write ""California has the most people"". Finally asked couple questions regarding my basic information address marital status height. Then officer asked if they approve if I'd be okay for a same day oat ceremony and officer stepped out. I believe I was the last one to do the interview I said yes I wasn't expecting a same day since they called to the interview around 1:30 pm.. Officer was very nice and polite very thorough.

1i5g45y,Conditional Resident to Citizenship in 7 weeks!,u/Negatibooo,536,108,2025-01-20T02:38:54+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1i5g45y/conditional_resident_to_citizenship_in_7_weeks/,False,[],"For those who may not know, you can apply for U.S. citizenship even as a conditional resident if you serve in the Armed Forces. Speaking from my experience in the Air Force, the process was smooth, efficient, and incredibly fast. I didn’t even need to go through the I-751 removal of conditions.

The U.S. Air Force is fully committed to helping trainees become naturalized citizens before graduation. It’s a significant milestone, and we are recognized for it during the ceremony.

The process begins on Day 1 of basic military training (BMT). All trainees with green cards are identified, and our information is collected to start the process. During the first week, we had an appointment with the USCIS liaison office on base. There, we created or updated our USCIS accounts, uploaded essential documents like our Green Card and Driver’s License, and answered questions about our addresses, jobs, and education—similar to the green card application process. At this stage, the application remained in draft form, and we used our own phones to complete it.

During the second week, we received our N-426 Certification of Military or Naval Service, signed by the BMT commander. This document is key to the citizenship process. Once we uploaded it, we finalized and submitted our application. The liaison ensured the application was expedited for faster processing.

In the third week, we completed biometrics. Since I had already done mine for my I-485 application, I didn’t need to repeat it, but others did. It was the same process as before. From that point on, all that was left was the interview, civics test, and oath ceremony.

We were given study materials for the 100-question civics test, which was straightforward, and everyone passed. The interview and oath-taking can happen anytime between Weeks 4 and 7, but for us, it was scheduled the day before graduation.

Everything went smoothly. By the time we graduated as Airmen of the world’s greatest Air Force, we were also proud U.S. citizens.

This journey isn’t just about me. I’m now working on petitioning for my mother so she can join me here. She deserves a better life, and I’m doing this for her. Serving in the Air Force has been life-changing—not just for me, but for my family.",USCIS

We arrived about 20 minutes early for our 8:00 AM appointment. 

A man called my name, and we followed him to his office. Upon entering, we noticed many posters of soccer and the Dodgers. It was clear he was a huge fan of both.

Naturally, we were nervous, but he reassured us not to worry, telling us that he wasn’t a bad person. He began reviewing our case on the computer and asked us to take an oath, which we did.

Before diving into the formal questions, we started talking about sports—football, baseball, basketball, and soccer. It was a pleasant conversation.

Then, he began asking us some basic questions:

""What’s your name?""
""What’s your birthdate?""
""What’s your current address?""
Next, he asked me several yes/no questions:

""Have you ever been arrested?""
""Have you been involved in drug trafficking?""
""Have you ever been deported?""
""Have you ever left the United States?""
""Have you committed fraud against the federal government?""

I answered No to all questions. 

He then asked if we had any additional evidence. We showed him our large file, probably over 250 pages. I asked if he wanted the photos from our timeline, and he said yes, it would be helpful. I handed him about 80 pages of photos documenting our timeline. He asked if we had any wedding photos, and I told him they were included in the timeline.

He scanned all 80 pages and then asked if we had any rental or mortgage documents. I explained that we didn’t because we live with my parents and take care of the house. He reassured us, saying, “Don’t worry about it. I believe you. You’ve given me plenty of evidence with the 80 pages of photos.”

While he worked, we chatted about the Lakers and Dodgers, as we are huge fans of both teams. We shared some jokes and laughed together.

Finally, he completed the process, stood up, and handed me a letter. He pointed to the word ""approved.""

My wife and I became emotional. We were overjoyed and hugged each other. Of course, my wife cried.

We are grateful to have had such a kind and considerate officer handling our case.

My wife and I have been together for 8 years and married for 2 years.

He asked for my address, work, travel, husband and the ""have you ever"" questions. I didn't put in my form my traffic citations but told him about it when he asked about citations. He said that it doesn't disquality my eligibility which was a relief. He asked if I'm going to travel soon and I said yes. Then told me that I can do the oath taking that afternoon or he can schedule me after my international trip. I said I wanted to do it that day and will just figure out my passport after.

My green card is expired since March. 

I went to Italy for a week with a green card expired since March, I did bring with me my extension letter that I received when I applied for removal conditions I-751.

I do have global entry, as I love to travel abroad. Coming back, when I arrived at Boston Logan. When I scanned my passport the machine asked to scan another document, then I scanned my expired green card, on the screen showed to proceed to the line and to talk to an agent. 

The agent was super polite, I showed my green card and passport. For some reason in his system it was showing that I didn’t have global entry (probably because my green card is expired). He asked me for my global entry card. I showed him, he asked how was my trip, asked me if I had something to declare and to finalize he said I can continue to use the global entry, because he knows how long it takes the process to get a new green card and said: Welcome back!

I’m not really afraid to travel abroad, I have to other trips overseas schedule for this year so far.

First, I want to thank everyone on this sub for your support and help (those who posted their experience, those who commented on the posts, and those who answered my questions over the years).

I am going to provide as many details as possible that might be helpful to our future citizens.

Field Office: Santa Ana, California. Ask me any questions!

My timeline:

* Aug/2021 - Applied for I-485 marriage based
* May/2022 - Conditional Green Card Approved
* March/2024 - Applied for I-751
* March/2025 - Applied for N-400 marriage based (3-year rule)
* Aug/2025 - N400 - Interview was scheduled (we were preparing for a Combo interview but then->>)
* Early Sep/2025 - I-751 approved
* Sep/27/2025 - Interview - passed civic test, recommended for approval, asked for same day oath, attended ceremony with about 5 other people, became US citizen all within 1 hour. 
* It felt surreal the moment I received my Certificate of Naturalization, that everything was over, and I am a citizen. I even asked the person who did our ceremony that ""is it done?"".
* **6 Questions civic test:**

1. What's the Supreme law of the land?
2. Before he was President, Eisenhower was a general. What war was he in?
3. There were 13 original states. Name three.
4. The House of Representatives has how many voting members?
5. Who does a U.S. Senator represent?
6. We elect a President for how many years?

* **Reading and writing questions:** Who was Abraham Lincoln? Abraham Lincoln was the president during the civil war.

Anything **special** about my case? Not really except for a speeding ticket 10 years ago and a ticket for using mobile device at the red light from 5 years ago, so I answered **YES** to question **15.b** in part 9 in form N-400 **""**Have you **EVER** been arrested, cited, detained or confined by any law enforcement officer, military official (in the U.S. or elsewhere), or immigration official for any reason, or been charged with a crime or offense?"", and uploaded all the records I could find showing everything was taken care of.

\*\*The officer asked this question during the interview, I again, answered, **YES**. He then asked, what happened, I explained, then he asked if I paid the tickets, I answered YES. No records were requested.

What else was being asked during my N-400?

* The officer went over about 90% of the questions on the N-400 application
* Additionally, he asked if i owned taxes, where I worked, what I do for work, do i rent/own?, he asked for my lease agreement, which I provided.

My tips to you for this entire process(from I-485 to N-400)

* Don't check USCIS page every day for status update, it just drives you crazy
* Your email is the best tool to get alert when there are updates on your applications
* Relax during interview (I was too nervous and the officer told me to relax)
* Make sure to download the N-400 Electronic Copy to review the ENTIRE application before your interview because the officer will go the application with you after the civic test.
* If everything on your N400 is correct and true up until your interview, then answer them EXACTLY like in the application.
* If you make a mistake on your N400, or an answer is no longer applicable or whatever that case is, that is OKAY, just let the officer know right after you took the interview Oath.
* Apply for I-751 and N-400 right away using the 90-day window
* Things are constantly changing, apply ASAP and get things done, be ready, be prepared and be organized. 

Good luck, everyone!

I’d like to share my timeline and experience of receiving a Refugee Travel Document (RTD). It’s been a difficult and emotional journey.

One of my family members became very seriously ill, so on July 8th, 2024, I sent my I-131 application to USCIS with a request for expedited processing. I included medical records from my family member as supporting evidence.

After six months of waiting, I began calling USCIS regularly. Every time, I got the same response:

“Your application is within normal processing time, and unfortunately, your request does not qualify for expedited processing.”

It was frustrating and disheartening, but I kept calling—almost every month.

After 15 months of waiting, something unexpected happened. On the morning of October 8th, I received a USPS Informed Delivery email showing an image of a letter from the USCIS processing center. Curious, I immediately checked my myUSCIS account—and to my surprise, I saw a new update:

“Your Refugee Travel Document has been produced and sent for delivery.”

That moment was such a relief.

This whole process took a toll on me. I had to see a psychiatrist several times and take prescribed medication to manage the stress. But thanks to God and my supportive family, I made it through.

Now, I’m facing a new dilemma. With the current administration, I’m nervous about traveling abroad. I have less than a year before my RTD expires, so I need to decide whether to travel or wait until I receive my Green Card.

If anyone has gone through a similar situation, I’d really appreciate hearing about your experience or any advice you might have.",USCIS

I immigrated to the U.S. on a K-2 visa (as the child of a K-1 Fiancé Visa holder). Like many, I went through the grueling I-485 Adjustment of Status process and was approved for a 2-year Conditional Green Card.

I started from the bottom, working as a cashier in a small grocery store, juggling multiple jobs just to make ends meet. But looming over me was the I-751 Removal of Conditions. The thought of going through another long, expensive USCIS process was overwhelming. The fees, the wait, the uncertainty. It was mentally exhausting. All of this, while trying to adjust to life in a new country.

Then I discovered a game-changer: military service.

I learned that the U.S. military accepts 2-year Green Card holders and offers an expedited path to citizenship. I would not go to the entire process of renewing to a 10 year GC, and applying for citizenship on God knows when. 

So I enlisted. I signed the contract, pushed through Basic Training, and graduated. I was among the proud few who were sworn in as new U.S. Citizens during graduation. That feeling is UNREAL.

Initially, I joined for citizenship. But the military gave me so much more. It gave me a career. I went from being a cashier, dishwasher, and hotel cleaner to becoming a medic in the United States Air Force. I now travel across states, have stability, benefits, and a future that once seemed out of reach.

All of this because I got frustrated.
Because I did my research.
Because I refused to let USCIS control my timeline.

It’s a love-hate relationship with USCIS no doubt. But looking back, every struggle brought me here.

I am open for questions!",USCIS

Even the so called cancel birthright citizenship (which is the only thing he mentioned related to legal immigration) only affects future immigrants after January and cannot be passed without an extra amendment which would not pass unless 3/4 of the state ratifies it (which is impossible if you check the numbers of blue states and red states and who is holding state assembly majority). Ending birthright citizenship needs an constitutional amendment not an executive order unlike what he run his mouth with. For de-naturalization, do you guys not understand how incredibly difficult it is to de-naturalize a citizen? There is a list on Wikipedia about every citizen that has been de-naturalized and most of them is Nazi during WW2 with a few of them being recent time immigrants that committed major crime or fraud BEFORE they acquire citizenship. Plus, on top of that, Trump has NEVER mentioned or said anything about the so called de-naturalization 


Lastly, you all realized that the worst case scenario such as bypassing laws and constitutions to deport citizens that some of y’all mentioned, would likely lead to a civil war in the United States similar to Myanmar? Our country is already on the verge of civil collapse. Even if Trump is crazy, he is logical enough to understand what he can and cannot do and what public boundaries are.


Please calm down, the only affect trump would have is similar to his last administration where green card visa processing time that is much more sluggish, maybe change the N400 test to be the harder version when he was the president and that’s about it.",USCIS

From what I’ve gathered, it doesn’t make sense to apply for the waiver given 1. There is only 5 years left on the ban and 2. The current administration. When the ten years are up (or close to it) my husband and I will find a competent attorney and discuss what it might take for me to be able to visit the USA again and go from there. ***

Has anyone ever had success with waiving the ten year ban?

I am a Canadian citizen married to a US citizen. When I was 26 or so I moved to the US, but overstayed my visa during the process of applying for my green card (it took us a while to save money). I can’t remember how long I overstayed, maybe slightly over a year..?

Under the first trump administration I was denied green card (my attorney was shocked, as she was confident my overstay would be pardoned because we have a genuine marriage).

I was denied in 2020 and got the ten year ban. They denied me claiming financial concerns, that I’d be a public ward. At the time my husband and I were both fairly young (20’s) and not financially established yet.

I left in 2020 of my own accord to move back to Canada with him. We applied for his permanent residence, which he successfully got. He now has a great career making over 100k/a year and I will be completing my grad studies this year and becoming a licensed psychotherapist, which will afford us even more financial security. I say this because we are both much more established than when I was banned, and that was their apparent reason to deny me. It’s also our intention to buy a home in Canada very soon.

We have a lovely life in Canada, but I haven’t seen his side of the family since 2020. Every time he goes home, we’re stuck apart. We were obviously stupid back then and didn’t grasp the gravity of the situation, but we certainly do now.

I’m wondering if anyone has had success waiving this ban? Any stories at all would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I understand that my denial was based on public charge concern. I also understand that I was NOT denied because of unlawful presence, but that the unlawful presence simply results automatically in the ban.",USCIS

Naturalized in the Salt Lake City Field Office this morning along with others from many different countries.   It was great to watch the naturalization of people from Burma, Nepal, Laos, New Zealand, Finland, India, China, Mexico, El Salvador, Ecuador, Bolivia, Germany, American Samoa, Syria, Vietnam, and others I’m sure I missed.

 - Green Card issued August 2019 after 15 years or so in the US
 - N400 filed March 15, 2025
 - Interview August 28th, 2025
 - Ceremony this morning, Oct 2nd!
 
First actions after naturalization? Had a lovely brunch in the sun at Liberty Park in Salt Lake and handed my voter registration form in by hand to my County Clerk’s office.

And then I made a donation to the National Immigration Law Center.   One of the most important things I can do now is help keep the door unlocked and the porch light on for those who follow.  Shout out to the German woman who got up and spoke near the end of the ceremony about her journey and the importance of immigrant rights in these times.  It was powerful.

Now off to do a N600 for my child, driver’s license update, passports etc etc.  The paperwork stops at some point, right??!!??

I'm part of a group of over 500 Ukrainian humanitarian parolees who legally entered the U.S. through the Uniting for Ukraine program.

We filed timely applications to renew our Employment Authorization Documents (Form I-765, category C11) — but since early 2025, USCIS has placed a de facto processing hold on these cases.

It’s been over 3 months, and no one is getting approvals.
Not a single C11/C19 based EAD for a Ukrainian parolee has been issued in that time — regardless of receipt date, evidence, or service center.

This isn’t just a delay — this is a total freeze.
There has been no formal announcement, no posted guidance, no timeline, and no recourse.

As a result:

Hundreds of us have lost jobs and health insurance

People are being evicted or going into debt

Some are being forced to consider returning to warzones or occupied regions, because they simply cannot survive here anymore

We’ve contacted USCIS, congressional offices, the Ombudsman, and even national media. So far — total silence.

We’re looking for:

Anyone else in the same situation (please share your timelines)

Legal guidance or action

Journalists or advocates willing to investigate this quiet humanitarian failure

We surrendered everything into His hands, believing that His plans are greater than my plan. And truly, in His mercy, He turned my worry into hope. In such a short time, what seemed impossible became possible—my Green Card was approved.

This was not because of my own strength, but because of the goodness and faithfulness of the Lord. He reminded me that He is the God who makes a way where there seems to be no way, and that His grace is always greater than my shortcomings.

📖 “Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.” – Isaiah 41:10

To those who are afraid or waiting for their breakthrough: do not be afraid. Trust in the Lord, for He knows the desires of your heart. What He has planned for you will always be better than what you can imagine. If He did it for me, He can do it for you too.

All glory belongs to Him alone, for He is the One who opened the door and gave me a new beginning.",USCIS

There's no doubt our marriage is real and we had nothing to hide. We moved in pretty quick together and got married officially after she was divorced so there were a few red flags. I am praying and hoping this works in our favor and we get approved soon. I love my wife dearly. Just waiting for an interview now in the office.

So basically, he needed more evidence. My marriage is completely real.

The officer noted that it seemed too coincidental that we arrived in the U.S., got married three months later, and then submitted the paperwork four months after that, which he found suspicious. He also stated that while there is evidence of our relationship in 2022, we need to prove that we have been together since 2016. He emphasized that pictures alone are not enough. However, since we were just boyfriend and girlfriend at the time, it doesn’t make sense to expect shared bank accounts, property, or other documents typically associated with marriage.

Ultimately, he suggested two things: first, completing the medical requirement, as he cannot approve the application without it—my initial one expired since we submitted it in 2022; and second, providing pictures with visible timestamps to verify that we have been together since 2016. While we did submit pictures, he now wants proof that they were taken on the specified dates by checking the timestamps in the photo settings. Additionally, he repeatedly insisted that we upload more documentary evidence, as he believed pictures alone were insufficient.

This was very frustrating because, given our dating status at the time, we didn’t have shared assets or official documents. Now, we are unsure what other evidence we can provide beyond the pictures with the timestamps (screenshots, basically?).

We need to have everything ready by Friday before noon. He said he’d give us a call???

Has anyone else experienced something similar? I just feel like this is so unfair. We’ve been together since 2016, got married in 2022, and now someone is telling us our marriage isn’t real? WTF.",USCIS

1mjkol6,New USCIS policy re: Adjudication of I-130s for removable aliens,u/renegaderunningdog,404,348,2025-08-06T23:47:40+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/comments/1mjkol6/new_uscis_policy_re_adjudication_of_i130s_for/,True,[],"There have been a number of posts on this topic citing poorly written popular press articles. In an effort to clarify things, I am making this post to explain the policy update and to centralize discussion. All outstanding threads on the subject will be locked and all new threads on the subject will be removed.

On August 1st, USCIS issued [Policy Memo PA-2025-12](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-manual-updates/20250801-FamilyBasedImmigrants.pdf).

Of particular note is this bullet in the Policy Highlights:

- Explains that USCIS may issue an [Notice to Appear] if the alien beneficiary is otherwise removable since a family-based immigrant visa petition accords no immigration status or relief from removal.

This is a summary of a new section in the [Policy Manual](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-b-chapter-5#S-C-3)

""If USCIS determines the alien beneficiary is removeable and amenable to removal from the United States USCIS may issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) placing the beneficiary in removal proceedings. Petitioners and alien beneficiaries should be aware that a family-based petition accords no immigration status nor does it bar removal.""

It has always been true that an approved or pending I-130 does **not** in and of itself provide an immigration benefit. However, historically, USCIS has not used I-130 filings to find removable aliens to deport. The change is that they now will.

**Who is not affected by this change**:

1. Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary is outside the United States.
2. Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary remains in status.
3. Anyone who is filing an I-130 and an I-485 simultaneously.
4. Anyone who *has already* filed an I-130 and an I-485 (even if not concurrently).
5. Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary continues to have some sort of formal protection from deportation (e.g. DACA, TPS, Military Deferred Action or Parole In Place)
6. Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary is already in removal proceedings. (they can't NTA you twice)

**Anyone who is filing or has filed an I-130 where the beneficiary is in the United States and does not fall into the above categories should be concerned.** This might include people such as:

1. Beneficiaries who intend to seek an I-601A waiver to ultimately depart for consular processing.
2. Beneficiaries who are waiting for the petitioner to naturalize before filing I-485 (e.g. out-of-status spouses of LPRs)
3. Beneficiaries who are eligible to concurrently file I-485 but are not for some reason (We occasionally get posts from people on here who say they can't afford both forms at the same time. That's much more risky now)
4. Beneficiaries who are grandfathered aliens eventually able to adjust through 245(i) but need their petition to become current before they can file I-485.
5. Beneficiaries who have final orders of removal. While not explicitly stated, if USCIS is using I-130s to find aliens they can serve with NTAs, I don't see why they wouldn't use I-130s to find aliens already ordered deported.

Remember, when you file an I-130 for a beneficiary in the United States you are effectively raising your hand and telling the government who this person is, where they are, and that their immigration history is worth looking at. If they are removable that just got more risky. Petitioners probably should not file I-130s for people who do not fall into one of the six unaffected categories above without legal advice.",USCIS
