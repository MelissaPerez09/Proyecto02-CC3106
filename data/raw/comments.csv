1lcftjz,my0ezdc,u/Drimoss,2025-06-16T02:01:44+00:00,6,Ok what am I missing here? My husband is in the army and it has not made a difference to our case whatsoever. You're in the same queue as everyone else and you can expedite for an emergency like a deployment but apart from that joining the army does not make a difference from what I've experienced...

1lcftjz,my1dhzm,u/Tickly1,2025-06-16T06:20:42+00:00,2,"I went to basic with a 36 year old fully-fledged medical doctor from (i think) Libya...

The dude spent 4 years of his life working in ""services"" (3F1X1, it's like the worst job in the Air Force basically) in order to get his citizenship

And THEN, when he got out, it's not like he could just be a doctor in the US now... nope; those credits don't transfer.... So he used his TA and GI bill to earn his BSN!

I imagine he's an insanelyyy good nurse now... Oh, and he had like 5 kids when he joined"

The four years ""he"" was in the White House were challenging because he was incompetent more than anything else. Stephen Miller doesn't know how to write an EO that can survive review. Immigration lawyers are well advised to sharpen their APA / Mandamus Act skills and research venues and judges well in advance. From a mental health perspective we have to set client expectations early and repeat them often: USCIS / CBP / DOS does not care about your case. Bill appropriately and ethically.  For those of us in private practice this is not a charity we are running.  If a person can't afford legal services give them referrals to trusted non profits and wish them luck."

1glflxy,lw2jx4j,u/Decyohno,2024-11-08T12:51:17+00:00,7,"As a CIS officer, I have tried to break this down for people about how back logged everything is.   How few officers there are to process things.   Even if ""price"" isn't on the table as it's started saying, this isn't as simple as just signing an EO.   I play a lot of catch-up for a lot of backlogged processes.  I have seen court cases being scheduled out to 2026 and 2027 (and a few in 2028).   

We are a litigious country and often for good reasons.  This whole issue is being sold as a simple statement, but it's an insane amount of work to even try. As you said,  funding it would break the bank to hire people to round up people.  Let alone try and separate who is and isn't ""legal.""  Then countries have to accept deported individuals back. We can't just kick people out with nowhere to go legally.  Then there's accounting for holding people, guarding, moving, feeding, legal fees, etc.   And that's all separate from having enough people to process the paperwork.  

 Bureaucracy in and of itself is complicated for precisely this reason.  It's hard to do anything on a large level.  And for a governmental level, it's even harder.   The number of paper pushers like myself is a safe guard for both sides.   It makes things take longer and can punish both sides by being so difficult as well.   It makes it harder for institutions to be short cutted.   The laws, the paperwork, the people to handle both, and the people to argue with each other over the paperwork all create road blocks to major changes like this.   

I'm not saying it can't or won't be done.   But by the time we get the paperwork settled, it will probably (hopefully) be someone else in the oval office. 

Trust in our legal systems and work with lawyers if you can. This is from someone on the side of the lawyers ire usually. And please, for anyone out there with an interest in law, please consider immigration law.   We need more lawyers and judges out there in the best of times.  We need them even more now."

Accredited representative with a nonprofit organization here. At least in my area, ALL of the organizations are at capacity pretty much ALL the time. Some keep waitlists; many do not. Most limit the intake line—open the phone line one day a week until they get the 50-100 calls or do so they can do their consults for the week and only a few of those they take, based on case selection criteria.

People call us constantly—both from the detention center and non-detained—because they call the EOIR pro bono list and can’t get through, get put on hold for an hour and get dropped, leave messages that don’t get returned, etc. They are desperate. No shade on those orgs that are on that list. Those are our colleagues! And really there is no other way to do it. The demand just vastly outweighs the capacity.

And I’m in California where many of the organizations have funding from the state government. I can’t even imagine that it’s like in other states where there is no state support and they are having to rely exclusively on private philanthropy, foundation grants, and service fees.

We nonprofits are in dire need of competent and reputable immigration attorneys in private practice to refer folks to who will not take advantage of their vulnerability!"

I'm a DACA recipient who needs expedited AP for cancer treatment and was recommended that I needed a minimum 1 year for it. I got i-131, doctor's notes that state I need 1 years treatment, xrays, i-131, etc. 

The thing is that I have a current AOS via family.

USCIS agent gave me 2 addresses. Which do I send it to:

USCIS, ATTN: AOS, PO BOX 4109, Carol Stream, IL 60197-4109 or USCIS ATTN: DACA, PO BOX 20700, Pheonix AZ 85036-0700?"

My dad had a few problems over the years because he NEVER had a naturalization record despite being born in the UK.  He had never professed allegiance to the U.S. because he arrived when he was only months old with his family.  The U.S. government deemed him an American when his mom became an American.  He wasn't accepted into the Navy until he got a letter from U.S. Immigration that they had deemed him an American and when.  Once he got that then they accepted him into the Navy.  When he finally retired after having worked for the federal government 25 years and served in the Navy for 20 years SSA tried to tell him he was NOT an American citizen.  He had to once again write to U.S. Immigration and get a letter of when they deemed him to be an American citizen."

The trend we noticed was that even a MINOR infraction - like a speeding or parking ticket within the last two years was enough for DHS to terminate student’s record. It was beyond ridiculous and extremely stressful. Now from what I know, after DHS got collectively hit by more than 100 lawsuits from schools across the country, they backed off and reinstated the vast majority of those student records, but just the fact that the government finds it appropriate to cancel status left and right without due process is astonishing"

1i8arwf,m8z30zx,u/Parking_Lemon_4371,2025-01-24T20:33:21+00:00,3,"Right...

I tend to agree that the pre-Trump era interpretation/implementation of birthright citizenship is too broad (\*and\* too narrow at the same time).

To give extremely edge case examples:

\* Child born on a US flight passing through US airspace -> US citizen for life.  Does not need to ever set foot on US ground (though it's likely very hard to prove...).  \[note: I'm not even sure it has to be a US flight/plane/carrier\]

\* Child born on a boat in international waters a day before it lands in the US, grows up in the US, attends school in the US, never leaves the US, 18th birthday comes around -> still not a US citizen.

However, it is clearly following/honoring the spirit of the 14th constitutional amendment, and as such changing it \*requires\* another constitutional amendment (which is virtually impossible to pull off in the current political climate for something like this, since there's no wide agreement... but that's a different issue).

Note: I myself was born in the UK (to non UK citizen parents that were on a 6-month university exchange program), prior to the 1983 change to their 'jus soli' law, thus I have UK citizenship... even though I've spent something like 5 months in total (\~75% of that as a newborn baby) in the UK over the past decades.  Does this make \*any\* sense?  Nope.  I mean if I had actually grown up there, went to school there... different case entirely.

So yeah, the law isn't great, and should be changed (like the UK did), but there is a well defined process for it, and AFAIK it doesn't involve the executive branch of government at all."

Screw that.  Moved back to the EU where residency was immediate, based on her marriage to me. Yes the US system is inhumane."
1h7t1fl,m0qkawt,u/MercuryAI,2024-12-06T17:33:50+00:00,10,"Hi there. I interview immigrants. Let me put some numbers to this for you. 

Allow, as a bottom number, 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. That was the estimate during the Obama administration, and I guarantee you it's gone up since then. Some estimates have it as high as 23 million.

Assume that 2/3 of them intend to stay - I think the number is probably much higher (more like 95%), but I picked 2/3 as a number that is super defensible. Unless these 2/3 intend to remain working under the table or cleaning houses their entire life, they need some kind of status. I am not saying your marriage is to an undocumented immigrant, but I am saying that this is a bottom floor number for people who want status in the US.

The statuses that are open to them are basically LPR (lawful permanent resident), citizen, or asylum. Yes, there are some wrinkles like T, U, or V visas, but those are comparatively very small in numbers and you need a law enforcement agency to sponsor you. So basically, their options are to marry someone, have one of their relatives who is a citizen/LPR sponsor them, or file for asylum. The odds of getting asylum are about 1/6, so most of them go the other way.

Now remember that every single one of these cases has to have an officer review and make determinations on these cases.  These officers don't grow on trees. Figure 8 months from hire date to being able to review routine cases unsupervised, and there is a 6-week, 8 hour a day academy in there for formal training. 

Now remember that there is a very high incidence of fraud in these cases - roughly 1/3 of marriages in the Los Angeles area are fraudulent, meaning that USCIS can break them with one to two phone calls, or during the interview. These interviews are effectively legal depositions under oath - while they are intended to be quick, when there are credibility problems, they definitely take longer. The incidents of fraud are so bad that most officers look askance at marriages that are less than 2 years old, and usually want additional proof that the marriage is genuine, and not just legally valid. Whenever an officer demands that proof, that means the case gets put back on the shelf, and oftentimes there may be a second interview. 

Now remember that there are only about 23,000 workers at USCIS, and that is including every secretary, supervisor, file clerk, and officer. The officers are a fraction of that total. Furthermore, these officers are specialized - some are experts in asylum law, some are experts in employment law, and some are experts at the laws applying to families. Officers that are specialized in one won't work the other cases, which makes sense. Would you assign a homicide detective to car theft? All of these categories are important, but some are more important than others - an employment petition that gets held up can be said to affect US employment by affecting the company. In comparison, family petitions have a much lower profile.

Finally, remember that USCIS is a fee supported agency, and that historically the US has *always* viewed immigration skeptically. A few years ago USCIS nearly went bankrupt because they had invested hundreds of millions in technology to intended to cut down things like processing times, and COVID left them with a budget shortfall. Congress didn't do shit for them (in fact, didn't even help them to secure a *loan* from the treasury), and for 8 months they were all told to be prepared to go on furlough in 2 weeks. My point is that Congress doesn't really care about the immigration backlog - because most of their constituents view it skeptically, because it is a political hot button, and because the laws surrounding it are incredibly complex. Congress doesn't WANT to touch it. 

In light of these challenges, that 47 months makes a lot of sense."

It needs to be first in and first out. They state American citizens get preference but I don't see that. If you really dig you will see that the form type can be identical as well as the filing office, case details of the same complexity, and the processing time has absolutely no rhyme or reason.  They need to be held accountable. People having to pay an additional 5k to 7k to sue so USCS looks at their case is not right. You pay for a service, it should be rendered quickly. No other agency requires payment and holds the service over your head for an indefinite period of time.

Taking years to process something and offering absolutely no transparency is complete nonsense.

That is why u see 1/10th of people get their stuff almost instantly and others drag for years. It brings their average process time down.

I am also a disabled combat veteran of the GWOT and a medically retired police officer. We did our duty as Americans and get treated like shit by the government. The VA, USCIS, ICE, etc. The entire immigration system in America is broken, to begin with. Charging families thousands of dollars and in many cases forcing them to be apart for months or years is despicable. 

I also despise how politics comes into play. For instance, if you are a Ukrainian fleeing the war then you get to go to the front of the line but if you are a Russian, Belarusian, Kazakh, etc. fleeing the war then you have to wait and do not qualify for any of the assistance the Ukrainian refugees do. We came from a non-Ukrainian country fleeing the war, were targeted by the government for being American, and even had everything verified and substantiated by the FBI and State Department but are being treated like shit by the system because we didn’t flee from Ukraine. I guess we should have crossed the border into Ukraine first so that we could get special treatment too. 

The entire situation pisses me off and is completely unfair to the rest of the people suffering from this war. I get that America is using Ukraine to fight a proxy war against Russia but there are millions of non-Ukrainians who also are against the war and have fled as political refugees as well. What about the rest of us?

I am disgusted by the way America has handled this situation and legal immigration in general."

First, I've never heard of anyone who took this long in adjustment of status for the ""immediately relative"" category,  Everyone I know completed it in about a year, and I know many! Only those spouses of permanent residents take about this much in processing time.

Second, as long as you have filed the I-485, your spouse shouldn't need to wait for its processing to feel secure. Once the form is filed, your spouse becomes eligible for work permit and her status becomes legal, even if whatever status she was previously on expires.

Third, while bureaucracy in the US sucks, there are only very few other nations who have these things easier. Tbh, immigration is never supposed to be a walk in the park and, as an American, you don't want that. The system is already abused as it is, especially for marriage-based immigration."

Unfortunately, this doesn't really mean that much. It should, but it doesn't. 

>unjust process times

This is a direct result of the COVID backlog and being severely understaffed. There is an insane backlog that only gets bigger every day. There's a limited number of people to review and adjudicate these. ISOs I know are working 10+ at a time, those doing interviews are expected to do 8-10 per day. Leadership is pressuring people to adjudicate so they can report high numbers. People are getting burnt out fast. 

>Fear of deportation

If your wife is doing AOS, she's not getting deported. 

>Not being able to safely see family and travel

This is what AP is for. If it's an emergency, get an EAP. I've seen EAPs get approved within 48 hours. I just made an appointment for one today. They requested it in the morning. A few hours later I called them and scheduled the appointment for the same day. 

>If you don't have enough case workers, hire more

It's not that simple. First, there has to be people that want to apply. There's a stigma on people who work in immigration. I don't tell people where I work for a reason. Second, they should incentivize people to want to work and stay. Maybe not starting people at GS-5 or 7 would be a start. And not overworking those that are already at the agency.

Answer: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jurisdiction#:~:text=noun-,ju%C2%B7%E2%80%8Bris%C2%B7%E2%80%8Bdic%C2%B7%E2%80%8Btion%20%CB%8Cju%CC%87r%2D,power%20to%20govern%20or%20legislate

If temporary residents do not fall in US “jurisdiction” as per EO, they shouldn’t be liable to any taxes or to any courts just as a “diplomat”. If that is the case, they can’t apply GC or Citizenship as they don’t fall in jurisdiction.

This brings a huge mess in the country and that is what new president needs to buy time. A huge agitation in society to ring his arrival! Fair enough 

Everyone eyes are on SCOTUS. If SCOTUS needs the mockery of US constitution, judiciary and flagship of a welcoming culture, they should interpret it as the president wants!

If not, stay calm.

I just received my EAD Card, SS Card & waiting for my AOS processing. I’m anxious about the new policy of our new president. I entered the US Legally w/ my us citizen spouse (tourist visa and adjusted status here)

In case of an ICE raid in my residence, am I in a risk of detention & deportation?"

Some more details

* Lived in USA since 2018 under a work visa
* Obtained Canadian PR in June 2023 and travelled to Canada to formalize my Canadian PR status and receive PR card. Returned back to USA in 2 days
* Received US green card after I-485 got approved in July 2023
* Since receiving US green card have made 3 international trips and returned back smoothly
* Since receiving US green card, I have never ever visited Canada (thus never used Canadian PR)

Can there be any legal scenario under which my US green card can be revoked. I have an international trip coming up in April and I am planning to renounce my Canadian green card ASAP.

Looking for opinions and thoughts from people who may be experts or in the same situation

Things to do:
1-Apply for a passport and passport card ( $30 and you can keep in your wallet )
2- Go to social security with your certificate on naturalization. 
3- Go to DMV and update your drivers license that you are US citizen ( if you have drivers license).
4-Register to vote if you like.
5- Travel the world 🌎 


Put your naturalization certificate in plastic cover and keep it safe. It takes time and is expensive to replace. "

If you do not have an unrestricted SS card, in 2 weeks, take your certificate to SSA and get one. Even if you do have an unrestricted SS card, go to SSA to update your status to U.S. citizenship. 

If you have less than a year left on your state photo ID / DL, after you get  your new SS proceed to the state DMV to renew.

After you have an unrestricted SS card in hand and state photo ID good for at least a year in head, then apply for both a U.S. passport and passport card. Kiss your cert good bye and pray for a reunion."

> I wasn’t hired because I did what USCIS told me to do.

> I became a citizen a couple of weeks ago. During the ceremony they hand you a packet that says the things you can now do as a citizen. The first thing on the list is getting a passport.

> I went and did just that the following week.

> A week later I got an interview and was hired on the spot.

  
> The employer is not willing to hire me without the original naturalization certificate, and I donù’t have it in my possession because I applied for a passport.

> I went to social security; and they still see me as restricted and as an alien, they actually still see me as a conditional permanent resident, I was extended in 2023, and I received my 10 year green card right before my ceremony.

> I am gutted that I am being denied my MAIN right as a citizen, to work, because I only have one way to prove I am a citizen and I handed it to the US dep of State.

> Do not get your passport done until you have been to your social security office, or if there is the slightest possibility of employment.

> In my case it was a total surprise as I had applied months ago."

I wish each time someone like you who put in the work, much harder work than anyone who's privileged enough to be born here, could name someone who's a born-here citizen who doesn't deserve to be here. I wish you had the power to say, ""I worked so hard to get here and I will always uphold the callings of the U.S. Constitution. Further, I name Donald Trump to lose his U.S. citizenship immediately and be deported within a week."" It must cut deep how you worked so hard for your right to be here while we're magas tear our country apart and piss on the very document you've spent months learning about and embraces and supported all statutes, amendments and the knowledge contained in the precious document. However, I recognize we can only wish for the deportation of Adolf Orange and those like him. 

The but true joy of your post is you set out to do something that will allow you to make so many positive changes in your life. I and your fellow Redditors are very proud of your amazing accomplishments. Thank you for caring about the U.S. enough to embrace your citizenship and acknowledge the privilege that it is. And never be afraid to stand up for the rights and liberties for which you fought in your quest to become an American citizen. We're so happy to have you."

If you are here legally no matter what visa you are on they have this. I don’t know why people are panicking for no reason.

Very easy- on the yearly tax bill, if they only put a column on there- how much of the taxpayers tax went to pay for education for illegal children and how much tax went to pay for care of illegals at county hospital AND YOU WILL SEE EVEN DEMOCRAT taxpayers in arms as to why they should have to pay.

I had no idea that this had happened until I got a letter from King county for jury duty in 2012. I wrote a certified letter back stating

1. I was a legal permanent resident with a LPR. 
2. Not a citizen
3. Shouldn’t be registered to vote nor be called for jury duty. 

A captain with the sheriff’s department called me within a week and apologized for the accidental registration and appreciated my honesty on the situation. Thankfully it never went beyond that and when I renewed my green card in 2014, I disclosed what had happened. Again the honesty was appreciated. They asked “did you ever cast a ballot” and I said “no, if a ballot was cast in my name it was done without my permission and knowledge”.

Years and years ago, under the Obama administration, my green card expired while my citizenship application was being processed and the lawyers assured us that it was fine. Once they checked the system, and saw that we were in process, they would let me go. It seems like I might have been arrested if that happened now.

Everyone here keeps wringing their hands and justifying the erosion of ALL OF OUR RIGHTS. “Well she overstayed.” “Well he shouldn’t have protested.” “Well he did miss his court date for the marijuana possession.” What we’re not understanding is this is where it starts, they start with these people which sets a precedent for the courts to use to get the rest of us. You’ll never get a pat on the head from xenophobes for being a good immigrant. 

Please understand that Marco Rubio said re: Mahmoud Khalil, “He entered the country on a visa and staying at any point after that isn’t a right, it’s a privilege.” But everyone not born in this country entered under a visa, immigrant or nonimmigrant/visitor. Today, for Mahmoud, it’s for exercising his first amendment rights. Tomorrow, for one of us, it might be for jaywalking."

*""While their saga isn’t over, the Trump voter’s wife detained by ICE is out of jail, for now.*

*An immigration judge let Camila Muñoz out of an ICE detention center in Louisiana, where she spent 49 days in custody, on a $3,000 bond. And she thinks the media coverage helped. Her story got nearly 2 million views on USA TODAY and was picked by national and local media.*

*Her husband, Bradley Bartell, drove 15 hours from Wisconsin the night before her bond hearing in Louisiana and was waiting for her. He doesn’t regret his vote, though.""*

There is a *possible* reason. One thing that is not clear to me is whether they filed the I485 and received the I797C, which should authorize her stay in the US despite the previous overstay and unauthorized employment. Is ICE detaining people even with I797C assuming there are no other delinquencies going on? Or are there things that we don't know about her yet? (i.e. criminal records?)

I am sure that in this guy's mind, ""she was one of the good ones,"" so he assumed everything would be OK. He should have known that the definition of ""good ones"" are not as clear cut as an average Joe and Jane might think..."

Too bad others are cutting the line, burning the American flag, and are giving people like you a bad name. Regardless of all the spin, hyperbole, and bias media, Americans on both sides of the aisle welcome folks like you, including the current President."

They told us they actually watch people sitting outside from the cameras and study their behavior, if they are nervous, if they are engaging with the spouse just to see if the relationship it’s real or fake. We had a whole album of photos and they didn’t want to look at them. They told us - it’s clearly you are a legit couple! That was years ago so nothing to do with an administration or the other…"

1jhpoak,mj973wy,u/Equivalent-Egg8585,2025-03-23T03:21:09+00:00,64,They can tell whether this is a good marriage or fraud the moment couple walks into their office after several years of doing this.
1jhpoak,mj9aew5,u/Spare_Hornet,2025-03-23T03:44:59+00:00,23,"Congrats! My AOS interview was similar. We waited for ages before we were called in by the officer. It felt like it wasn’t as much of an interview as an appointment to tell us we were approved. Super fast and easy. I spent so much time gathering documents, worrying about the wait, reading the stories of others that I actually asked the officer “Is that it?”. She laughed lol"
1jhpoak,mj9az0r,u/cutefroggiee,2025-03-23T03:49:10+00:00,25,Omg congratulations!! Claiming these positive vibes and energy for my upcoming interview haha. What was the status before adjusting if you don’t mind me asking!😊
1jhpoak,mjb3m7a,u/confusedquokka,2025-03-23T13:39:00+00:00,15,"They’ve already done the background check and know your history. They want to see you in person and after doing thousands of interviews, I’m sure they know after a few minutes who is real and who is not."

1jhpoak,mj9jcec,u/More-Requirement-131,2025-03-23T04:55:28+00:00,13,"Same happened to me, she asked why we waited four years to apply for AOS and we told her it was because we didn’t have the money. 
Then she said that we had enough evidence and she believed it to be a bona fide marriage. 
Approved my application right there."
1jhpoak,mj9dbdh,u/Mission-Carry-887,2025-03-23T04:06:52+00:00,9,"This was well written. I thought my heart was going to sink.

You have talent. 

Congrats."
1jhpoak,mj9cyql,u/circle22woman,2025-03-23T04:04:12+00:00,21,"The reason why it so was quick is because your case was low risk and had all the required information.

If you're from a low risk country (one without many sham marriages), you've been married for a while, have lived together the whole time, had kids together, lived a normal boring married life in the US, no criminal background, the officer is going to approve it without much investigation.

Congrats!"
1jhpoak,mjazebw,u/rubenprz,2025-03-23T13:11:15+00:00,9,"It is intentional. They like to see you interact with your partner to make a decision. They are studying both of you the entire time. To the point that I don't think it is about what you answer that much. It's about how you react and communicate with your partner. Even after hearing by the officer ""it is Approved,"" it is not 100% approved.

My GC interview was easy, too. She said, ""Your case is approved. I can already tell you guys are a couple by the way you talk to each other.""

By the way, she also needed to verify something, so we didn't get the documentation saying it was approved after the interview was over. A week later, we received a letter requesting one more paper that they needed, and we sent it, and then we got the update in the system and the letter in the mail of the approval.

I honestly don't think you will get that, but if you do, don't freak out. Just send what they need.

Congratulations 🎊 I've been married 8 years now. I'm a citizen now (that interview was the interesting one, lol). It is quite the journey, but it is worth it."

After reading through very scary posts on here it is nice to see people get good outcomes. A lot more people are being scheduled for interviews now and we need this type of energy.

When you’re legit married, they can just tell."
1jhpoak,mjamlaj,u/wmwmwm-x,2025-03-23T11:34:13+00:00,5,"80/100 times, these interviews are like 5 minutes. You never hear about them because people done post about it. It’s generally when things go south, people vent. 

And questions are generally asked to the sponsor. And then they ask follow up questions to the beneficiary (usually the 485 questions)"

The I130 has all your proof of bonafide marriage too and they would have already seen that. If they still had questions, they would have asked more."

From my own experience I realized when you go to your interview the more relaxed you are the higher chances your interview will be smooth. 
Treat it like a conversation with a person who wants to know you better lol"

They asked her what my parents names are and she had no idea, I have no idea what her parents names are either,  I just call them ‘mom/dad’ and Chinese names aren’t easy.  

They asked how we communicated and as soon as I started speaking Mandarin the whole tone of the interview changed and we were instantly-approved.  Out in 10-15 minutes total."
1jhpoak,mjif2w5,u/lucavl,2025-03-24T17:29:38+00:00,4,I don’t know much about the interviews but I assume given the stuff you already submitted as evidence they probably are 99% certain before the interview. I mean I didn’t even have an interview to get my green card (although it did take 2 years) so I’m sure for many people the interview is a formality rather than to completely vet people/ the relationships
1jhpoak,mj9894p,u/Embarrassed-Bike2060,2025-03-23T03:29:20+00:00,3,Congrats! Thats great!
1jhpoak,mj9j8t8,u/Sufficient_Egg6970,2025-03-23T04:54:37+00:00,3,"The officer is still within the purview of his duty, he must have glanced through your case before the interview and believes there is nothing to talk about.  For me, there is nothing like implicating him or her. 

The above also shows how an officer could discretionarily withhold your case for a very long time without just cause. Some may not like your name or country and decide to punish you

  
Anyways, congratulations in advance"

1jhpoak,mjazup2,u/NewWestGirl,2025-03-23T13:14:18+00:00,3,Mine was similar. He asked how we met. I showed him wedding album he glanced at it for like 10 seconds and said “oh clearly this is real approved”.  5 minute total maybe?

1jhpoak,mjibxct,u/segaard,2025-03-24T17:15:33+00:00,3,"I didn’t get my green card through marriage, but my citizenship interview was pretty similar. Friendly chatter with the interviewer asked the bare minimum required questions, and then told me I could swear my oath of allegiance later that afternoon. The longest part of the process was waiting on her computer to load and waiting on the scanner/printer. My interview was on the day after the 2024 election and she definitely was weary of how things were going to go with the new administration."
1jhpoak,mj99rii,u/Pretend-Society6139,2025-03-23T03:40:13+00:00,2,"I did my green card interview in Texas my husband at the time (we are divorced now) he was sweating and freaked out. The officer was very chill she asked us one or two basic questions related to us and then we spent the rest of the interview just talking about the Bahamas (where I’m from) she wanted tips on which island was the best to visit (Nassau imo or harbor island if you like pink sand). This year I applied for my citizenship(filed on my own cus I had divorced husband I’d had my green card for 6+ years ) during the interview process which was done in New Orleans the officer was super chill. She was finishing up a case cus someone came late and she said that if she closed their case they would show up for their interview (which they did haha) anyway I was a nervous wreck cus the night before we went to bourbon street and my wallet was stolen with my green card in it I was so upset but the agent said that’s no issue gave me a form to fill out an took my police report I had filed about the issue. We talked about what places to eat in New Orleans because it was my first time visiting and her son, also about the Bahamas 🤣I got my 6 questions passed and she got me in for the same day oath it was so chill. I want to also point out that I did my own filing and I went overboard with evidence I was thorough and detailed in every interaction about my marriage and had nothing for them to inspect me so this is why I assume they went easy on me during my interview. Also ppl from the Bahamas rarely travel and live in the state I live in I’m literally the only person from the West Indies they normally go to Florida, New York, New Jersey even Texas like they don’t stay in the city I choose to live in I’m sure it’s other Caribbean ppl around especially in Nola and maybe the college cities like Shreveport or bossier but those ppl leave when they are done. I’m here with my wife in the middle of nowhere and it’s genuine love that’s keeping me in this small town with her. We plan to move in the future but I love our lil home and life we’ve built."

I had similar experience,  summer 2021.
We just spend a few minutes and he said you are aproved,  and put a aproved stamp on my file paper. 
He said we have a lot of time, so you can ask me anything. 

So we just chatted about places he had visited,  if things were moving faster with new administration ( biden become president a few months before). 

It has more to do with your case and folder.
When you  have a lot doc and document your journey,  than no much to ask. Some people even get approved without interview. There were many cases."
1jhpoak,mj9ifg4,,2025-03-23T04:47:45+00:00,2,They review the files before the interview and he likely didn't see any issues with your case. So he didn't have any reason to do a lengthy interview.

You don't have more questions I brought a while 100 page folder with me lol! He said to keep it for my conditions removal interview - this was in 2021. We were out in a record 2 minutes! When we walked out, everyone in the waiting area watched us with jaws open. Most interviews were lasting at least 30 mins or more. 
While we were waiting to be called, my husband and I were just being ourselves, joking around trying to not think of the interview. All the anxiety leading up to the interview vanished in an instant."

Our GC interview (Employment based, but during Trump 1.0) was something like that. He just asked if I was working. It was in the middle of the morning so I was coming from work and intending to go back afterwards... so I had my badge dangling around. He asked my wife when we got married and then we chatted about irrelevant stuff for 10 minutes until he sent us our way.  He did say he was not happy about the employment based interviews because he was trained to detect marriage fraud and an employment based GC was document based and there was nothing really for him to do."

Same sex marriage USC and I - Removal of Conditions and naturalization interview all in one. We came 20 minutes early registered and were waiting for about 20 minutes. Then the officer came up to us and asked if we have additional paperwork. We started giving him piles of bank statements, insurance, house deed, taxes. He looked at all that and said: “Whoa, I don’t need any of that. I’ll take taxes for last year… Will be calling you guys soon.” He was really friendly. That helped a lot with pressure. We even noticed how relaxed we are filling after this interaction. So we waited another 20 minutes and finally got call in. He met and walk us back to his office. While we walked he said that he already approved our I-751 petition to remove conditions. He proceeded with interview for naturalization. Most of the interview we were talking about families, dogs, travel. At the end he said that he approved our case and that we are good to go. He showed us a short cut from office."
1jhpoak,mjiej2g,u/cantremembr,2025-03-24T17:26:59+00:00,2,"We had an interview just like this too. I was kind of worried about it because a lot of my friends have gotten GCs for their husbands and they had like, professional evidence (not actually even that much of a joke) and we had eloped after dating for two months (yeah I know) and had a grand total of 8 photos together. Got a joint account just for the application lol. But, it took us years to get the income requirement before filing so I think that worked in our favor. Also the officer said once you have a baby it's considered a legitimate marriage, crazy cause that seems almost stereotypical."

My husband and I did not have a pleasant experience despite the fact we had been together for 4 years, living together for 2, bank accounts merged and literally so much evidence, the interviewer had to use two hands to flip through it it was so thick and heavy. Our lawyer said we should have it easy but we weren’t so lucky. She gave us a lot of trouble and after 6 months with no answer, we finally got an approval after writing to our senator."

The officer started off the interview by saying something along the lines of: ""Before we start, I just want to let you know your I-751 application was approved"". I'm guessing it was in response to the 1,000+ pages I submitted with my I-751 and additional documentation submitted with the N-400. 

Didn't have to show any more evidence even though I had brought an entire box full of it. Just did the English and Civics tests and the officer announced my N-400 was also approved."

1jhpoak,mjnm00l,u/AssignmentHot8501,2025-03-25T14:02:46+00:00,2,My interview was chill too. My husband made a few jokes too. It was very cordial and chill.
1jhpoak,mjt1c8q,,2025-03-26T09:36:07+00:00,2,"I don’t want to sound like that, but it’s just a job to them, you’re just a number to them. They process so many applications that you’re just a number at the end of the day. My understanding is that they already have warning signs in your documents or previous applications that they will later scrutinize. Basically before they even see you, you already have been pre approved or destined to be grill further based on your paperwork or lack of."
1jhpoak,mjxr9yg,u/DanielEspinTattoo,2025-03-27T01:09:10+00:00,2,"My wife and I had a very similar interview, we waited for a while and then weren’t in the actual office for more than 15 minutes."
1jhpoak,mjypgb2,u/LawGaymer,2025-03-27T04:57:51+00:00,2,It’s supposed to be this straightforward. Officers are also just as annoyed as lawyers to have to interview folks. Alas the days of getting green cards in two months via mail is gone. Congratulations!
1jhpoak,mk2bgej,u/Western_Advance_7205,2025-03-27T20:03:57+00:00,2,"I have my interview in 2 weeks, and I really hope it goes the way yours did! 😅
Congratulations on getting the green card! Such a weight lifted!"
1jhpoak,mke1v3o,u/ambigua,2025-03-29T17:58:49+00:00,2,"Same. We were in and out in ten minutes, tried to show our photo albums, and we were bummed when the interviewer said “I don’t need to see anything else, thanks”.  

On the way to the interview I had spilled coffee in the new car. When we got back to the parking lot we had a small fight about it. When the interviewer walked past and heard us, she smiled, nodded, and said, “Yep, I knew you were ligit”…

We had been sooo nervous, and it took four years almost. Now I could just be grateful it went smoothly, but it feels arbitrary to not even do a thorough interview, when others are put through the ringer and sometimes denied. I am so sorry for all of the people suffering, it is not a fair system."
1jhpoak,mwwtpkx,u/Full_Relationship565,2025-06-09T22:09:20+00:00,2,"Same haha We just went today! The officer we had was super nice and his behavior was pretty calming. My husband and I went together. The only thing he wanted from us was our IDs, the interview invitation, and some 5 papers from the medical exam which I didn't have since I gave all my medical stuff to the airport staff when I arrived to the US, except for the vaccine record which he just found in the system. After that he asked what my full name was and when we got married. Then he said that from that moment it would be just us listening to him typing and he had me sign an electronic document with a two-item list of changes that he made to my case (just added an Alien number). We were even joking that the pen looked like a microphone.
That was it. He was probably the one working on our case from the beginning so he told us that because we have been in a relationship for a long time already (have been married for 11 months) our case is approved, the GC will come within 3 weeks, if not then we can call, and that in a year and 9 months we will have to apply for the ""real green card"" since this one is CF1 (a conditional GC because we haven't been married for 2 years).
Overall, the most pleasant experience with a government office I've ever had. Bless that officer :)"
1jhpoak,mj9htop,u/Zingobingobongo,2025-03-23T04:42:49+00:00,3,"I remember being nervous AF for my L2 visa interview in London. Finally got to the counter for the interview and he said “so you’re going to USA then?” 
“Thats the plan”
“Cool”"

1hbn8xf,m1hutf1,u/IndependentTest7747,2024-12-11T08:11:04+00:00,24,"Also in the same boat as OP. Been here 8 years. Multiple cities, Never has ssi benefits, doing all the right things, etc etc etc. 

Here’s my opinion. I have 2 lines of thought:

1. The economics of capitalist America benefits a lot from keeping immigration as a privilege, since a lot of the $$s coming in from student fees or higher level development projects are used to fund the nations growth and take care of Americans (which is fair). It is just another win for capitalism and a usual win-lose for the employees. I am an entrepreneur so this is what I believe and I believe this is what corporate America needs and believes as well. We are just a part of a system that helps the US succeed (also fair). Why would the US change its system, and worsen its overhead? If we can put up with the system, we can live here. If not, there are flights out everyday from all 3 cities you lived in. Of that, I am sure. I have been in your shoes and have even booked my flights to leave the country. But why have we stayed? 

Because:

2. we could look at being in the US as an actual “privilege” or as an opportunity given to us, unlike anything given to us at our home country. If not, why would we stay here 8 years? Or want to stay more? Everything we have ever done in this country, including moving here, has been “at will” just like employment, paying taxes, working for “lower” salaries, being in a place while not having the right to vote. We are definitely replaceable in this country. If not for us, someone else will do it. And by making it easy for us to get a green card, we really could be stealing jobs from Americans when things take a turn for the worst financially. Why would the US want that competition? 

I would also add that, the country I come from would definitely not treat immigrants as well as the US does. So I do believe it is a privilege since it really doesn’t need to be given to us. The rules could’ve just been written to get us in make us stay and leave after the work visa ends I.e for a regular student on F1, you spend $80-100k on education (2 years), work a job that pays you a “bad salary” of 80-100k for 6-8 years effectively banking, on the low end, $half a million. The payback and lifestyle doesn’t seem bad. But the rules allow us to stay (if we choose to go through the process)

I know the uncertainty sucks. I feel the same way sometimes. But yes, it is ruthless and seems unfair but we aren’t citizens and therefore aren’t treated as such. This is what we signed up for."

I’m assuming you used that privilege to travel here? 

B) A green card is a permanent resident card, not just a work permit. The I-765 is a work permit and for what its worth, there are many who don’t even have work permits but work without authorization and still pay taxes and contribute to the economy. Tourists also contribute to the economy by visiting. Some countries economies strictly rely on tourism so this point is moot. 

C) It is a privilege when both parties make the decision. You are privileged enough to afford your F1 visa and come to the US were you not? You were privileged enough to be accepted into your school were you not? You were privileged enough to get an OPT were you not? Or were these things given to you when you were in India because you had a right to them? Or did you choose this path?

D) Once you get a green card you are afforded rights that others such ad tourists do not have. 
If immigration was a right and not a privilege wouldn’t all the borders in the world be open and there wouldn’t be things such as the immigration process? 

1)Green card holders can receive social security benefits once eligible.

At least here in the US (not MINE-just explaining context generally used in)- the sentiment is that people do not have a RIGHT to choose to permanently move/migrate from their own country to another country.  

Once you have legitimately obtained permission to immigrate, you do have every right to the privileges and protections afforded you.  Problem is that many people believe that when they were given a TEMPORARY entrance such as a non-immigrant student or work visa that should automatically provide them the right to immigrate.  

You applied for and accepted a NONIMMIGRANT visa. You showed proof of your ties to and intent to return to your home country. The US allowed you the opportunity to get an education or work experience so that you could go home and contribute to your country.  You know at that time you are going to enhance the other country financially or intellectually but that is tradeoff you agreed to.

Also, you will receive social security benefits even without citizenship. While there are some rules that take citizenship into account, social security benefits are based on contributions, not citizenship.

I've felt the same pain through my own immigration journey, but I became a US citizen three years ago. I did that in part so I wouldn't have to worry about whatever draconian immigration reform was coming next, as the anti-immigrant zealots don't generally bother distinguishing between legal and illegal immigration.

So I sympathize. But in making that decision, ""the system"" is a factor you have to consider. And it is a fact that the US is losing out on talent to other countries because our immigration system is such a juggernaut. People who have choices tend to prefer a system with quick processing times, permanent residence either from day one or automatically after x number of years on a work permit, and not having to put their lives on hold for months or years because the system is backlogged or their priority date isn't current.

You're right, it's a choice that both parties make, and the US has made the choice that it wishes to discourage immigration.

Congratulations on your achievement to work at an Ivy League school. That being said, you absolutely are not working at a lower salary. Both my sister in law (brother's wife) and my partner's sister are green card holders and are some of the highest paid at their respective jobs. No one is ""depriving"" you of a fair chance.

While I do think you personally absolutely do deserve a green card or whatever they call it, I vehemently oppose immigration as a right.

Nobody is entitled to come to the United States and frankly unless you’re contributing in a significant way (like you outlined in 1 and 2), you don’t have any business in this country. 

Understand that a significant amount of opposition to immigration stems from an reasonable opposition to illegal immigration, and even opposition to immigration given the plentiful number of Americans that can do the same job, and it would be UNFAIR to label anyone opposed to immigration controls as racist.

Given the sheer number of illegal immigrants, I’m sorry to say they literally jumped the line and cut you. 

But onto my second point with regards to 1 and 2, yes you contribute a lot to this country, but almost any American can do the same. I study computer science at the undergraduate level currently and I plan to peruse grad school. The truth is PhD admissions are absolutely insane, and it really pisses me off that a lot of schools actively try to recruit international students in the name of “diversity” or whatever (definitely not Asians or on particular Indians). But regardless I can’t help but feel resentful especially given the sheer amount of super qualified and smart classmates I have (people like to label Americans as dumb for some reason, where not that dumb), and with regards to damn near everything here I just feel like there’s a lack of prioritization of American citizens. "

However, I am also not convinced that the government's case is just. The links I've seen read less like violent terrorist propaganda and more like ideological drivel. I think this case deserves its day in court, and I would particularly like to know:

What did Khalil actually say that makes him deportable? Even if he praised these organizations, did he actually praise and/or endorse violence against civilians?

How does the government define ""endorsing"" a terrorist organization? Are top European politicians who ""endorsed"" the coup d'etat in Syria now inadmissible to the United States?

Are these provisions of the INA compatible with the First Amendment, or do they constitute an unconstitutional restraint on foreigners' freedom of speech in the United States?

It’s not inherently anti-Jewish to oppose what Israel is doing to Palestinians, especially with the number of women and young children and civilians that have been murdered. 

He also is a green card holder, my friends who are green card holder college students have been here since their parents brought them here when they were babies and this country is all they have ever known. By all accounts, they are just as American as I am in my opinion. We are a country of immigrants and to me there is nothing more American than exercising your rights to freedom of speech about the things you believe are important to making the world a better place."

A lawful, permanent resident of the United States has been arrested for exercising his freedom of speech. 

The US government doesn’t like some of his OPINIONS and so they have arrested him and are making plans to deport him. 

Maybe you don’t like Mahmoud’s opinions. Maybe you don’t agree with him. Fine. But the point is: the US government is arresting LEGAL IMMIGRANTS — PEOPLE WITH GREEN CARDS — for *exercising their freedom of speech*.

This is not the behavior of a nation that is the “land of the free and the home of the brave.” It’s an act of profound cowardice and an arbitrary and cruel exercise of power. Also, his wife is a citizen 🤷‍♀️"

It looks like u crossed out ur name which was smart of u and It's hard to tell if u crossed out their address or call them and tell them about the letter. No agency is going to write u a letter that they're denying ur parole. U would have to have been in a Federal prison and sit in a room with a group of people telling u this and the reason. But I would call or send them the original letter and believe u think this is  a scam. If it is it a scam they will investigate who sent u this letter But do not expect an answer back, unless it isn't a scam. So before u get ur Hermes In an up roar check it out.

1lwgh90,n2f10bz,u/throwawayLA657,2025-07-10T19:15:36+00:00,35,"Same for us. Totally blew up all our preparation. My Chinese wife actually took a couple of weeks off from work before the interview to prepare. I found out later, her Chinese network of friends, helped her prepare well.

The day before the interview, we received the infamous, ""due to unforeseen circumstances, your interview is cancelled"" update on the website. My wife was devastated.

Fast forward to about 7:15AM the next day. I get the text alert to check the website for an update. The code goes to my wife's phone, I go wake her up, need your phone, now. Get logged in and we have a new appointment scheduled, yeah! But wait, it is for 8AM, TODAY!!! We live about 20 minutes from the Seattle/Tukwila office.

I had already put away most of our evidence, thinking it would be a month or longer before we would get another appointment. I grabbed an empty briefcase and started throwing in everything I could think of. We rush out the door and are checked in and in the waiting area by around 7:50. We had made it!!!

So my careful organization of evidence. My wife picking out her clothes, and mine, for the interview, Gone. Here we are, hadn't showered, my wife trying to fix her hair and makeup in the car. Thinking back , it was hilarious.

The interview was so casual, friendly, I was a bit taken aback. After a few questions directed to me, she said that takes care of the I-130, lets start on the I-485. My wife's preparation became so obvious, I was so proud of her. She answered every question, thru an interpreter, flawlessly, without any hesitation. When she got to the question about military or gun training, I kinda leaned away from my wife, waiting for her to answer. When she said no, I kinda chuckled and said nice to know, and the interviewer laughed. When they asked the questions about about how we met, when we dated, when did we get serious. I used that opportunity to pull out the photo album. The cover had a photo of us, and I said this is a picture of us at dinner the day before my birthday. That is also the first time she came home with me and we started talking about our future. She looked at the photo, and never opened it to see that other 50 photos we had prepared. My bulging briefcase of evidence, she did not ask to see anything.

We got to the end, and she said I can't give the answer now, I need to make sure her old asylum case has been withdrawn. But you are done here, you should get your approval in a couple of weeks.

My wife's friend, also going thru the process, told the story to her lawyer. He was convinced that last minute interview notice was a test to see if we were really living together. And since we actually made the appointment time, we passed. Kind of a sick test, my wife went thru almost 24 hours of hell after the cancellation.

But here we are, my wife has a beautiful 10 year Permanent Resident card. Remember the Chinese network I mentioned? We signed papers at the lawyers office in June of last year. I kept bugging my wife about a receipt number. We finally get one in October! When I realized my wife got a 10 year card, I said that was clever of your lawyer to delay sending the papers in. Our second anniversary was 4 weeks before the approval. That delay, had given her the 10 year card. She replied, that was me that told her to delay sending it in.

That Chinese network is amazing, lol"

""Do you have any known ties with any terrorist organizations? 

Do you intend on entering the United States to become a prostitute? 

Are you now or have you ever been a Child Soldier?""

My wife got mad at me for laughing at the ridiculousness because she was super nervous.

I've never seen a group that hates immigrants more than immigrants themselves.

**Edit:**

It confounds me that people would support and defend Trump when his group [\(without fail\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_views_of_Donald_Trump) has shown many times how they **dont care** about people of color (regardless of immigration status and/or social economic standing). ICE does not discriminate and **will** arrest anyone that just looks like they [""dont belong""](https://apnews.com/article/us-citizen-held-ice-florida-law-4b5f5d9c754b56c87d1d8b39dfedfc6c). 

How can you defend that? They hate **YOU** 

We can generalize that illegal immigrants are bad because they're ""illegal,"" but how can you not see that Trump's policy will affect **legal** immigrants? You're not concerned because you probably havent faced it yourself yet."

A few might self-reflect, ask themselves how will they know if they're being lied to, and come to a realization that they are voting against their own interests.


Unfortunately, the last group is shockingly low. I do hope they are willing to change course, and hopefully be angry enough at being lied to that they'll take action at a minimum with their vote."

My (45M)  husband (37M), a (gay) Mexican National, got his Green Card three months ago.

We've taken four international trips so far. Each time we've returned, we've been politely, dare I say, even welcomed back home by friendly BPO's. 

He and his mother started a commercial cleaning company and in less than three months have already secured just over $50,000 in monthly re-occurring revenue. 

We flew from home (Phoenix, AZ) to Washington DC to have lunch with our Republican Senator. Had a great time. Both parties shared a lot. Learned a lot. Even laughed a lot. 

I'm waking up this morning in our second home in Phoenix, because our domestic engineer (maid) was sick yesterday and didn't come make the master bed at our other home. So, we came here to sleep. 

A week after getting his green card and social security number he applied for three credit cards and was accepted for all. The lowest limit is $28,000. The other $50,000. The third is an Amex Platinum, so no limit. 
Hell, we even signed a loan for $274,000 to upgrade our Hilton Grand Vacations timeshare, and got an interest rate of just over 4%. We wouldn't normally finance something like that. However, he needs to have various credit lines to build his credit rating with. 

We are flying to Mexico next week to complete my (the American spouses) permanent resident process. 

We have seven cruises booked between now and January. Plus three other international trips. **Absolutely no fear or trepidation about traveling at all.**

We have great healthcare coverage. 
We have retirement accounts that are growing exponentially month after month. 

My companies are growing like crazy!!! 
Thanks to all the extreme employment nonsense the last administration put into place, I was able to start a new division/service in outsourcing/offshoring employees. 
The entrepreneurs and small business owners using my services to off-shore their workforce are seeing notable growth and success in their businesses and in turn, their personal lives. 

I (the Gringo) am meeting next month with the State RNC chair to discuss putting together an exploratory committee for a possible State Congressional run next election season. So far I have quite a bit of interest from possible constituents. *(None of whom gave a second thought to the fact that I'm gay and married to a Mexican btw.)*

As to Project 2025, look it only haunted those looking for a boogie man to be afraid of. Those of us who are actually out here creating our own lives and destines don't really have the time or interest in worrying about the hysteria surrounding something that's a non-issue to begin with. 

OP, would you share with us what good things are happening in your life, with your family, with your career?"

The Supreme Court had a chance to weigh in on this with the Texas case, but it ruled it's fine for the government to crush your freedom of speech as long as it's ""incidental"" crushing, whatever that is. I hate the Supreme Court.

I wouldn't know since I've used anonymity networks and VPNs for quite a while now. It's been widely known for many years that the NSA violates the US constitution and does everything from collecting ""metadata"" on Americans to knowing what brand of bottled water you drink.

They have access to everything. They have access to the payment networks, your bank accounts, your email. If you use proprietary operating systems and software, they get reports about the software installed on your computer, what the file contents are, what you are viewing on your screen.

That's what Microsoft RECALL is. It takes photos of your screen every time you open a program, and sends them to a data center to be analyzed. The government gets them. They get file hashes too, so as soon as anything they're interested in hits the storage on your computer they know about it.

They get detailed reports. If you use big American email providers, they're analyzing your email, inbound and outbound.

They know your browsing history, your keystrokes.

They know what you buy. They know where most people are down to within 1-2 feet due to GPS and cell tower triangulation.

When you're in public, you're probably recorded by cameras, whether they're city cameras, or even a Ring doorbell. That's why the police pay people to put them in. They are always watching you. They apply facial recognition. 

The person who installs the Ring doorbell has no real control over the data it collects, in at least a few cases they've ended up being prosecuted and sent to prison over their own doorbell recording them.

The government is supposed to follow Constitutional procedures, but it does not. It has found ways around all of them. Anything that ends up ""in the cloud"" or which goes through the payment network isn't yours anymore, and they get all your data just for the asking.

They already know everything about you. They already know if you're a threat to them.

So really, what's the point of anonymity networks or VPNs? Well, they route around internet censorship that state governments are starting to use, they make it look like you're somewhere else. The site doesn't know if you're in Texas or Switzerland, right? So there's plausible deniability.

They can say that they did everything they could to age verify people in Texas.

There's also copyright lawyers. They don't have the sort of resources the government does. It may provide protection from them if the VPN company is actually a good one that throws their letters in the trash and says ""We don't know who that was and they were on a server in the Netherlands.""

If you use Free Software like Linux along with anonymity networks like the Tor Browser, it may make it harder to prove state-level project 2025 crimes like ""Traveling to Illinois to get an abortion."" because States hit Google and Microsoft Bing with ""Who searched for abortion?"" and they work it backwards once they have your IP address and the info associated with your logged in account. Tor Browser says don't log in. That's why. 

The police do ""reverse searches"". They ask Google and Microsoft who has been searching for things, then they work backwards.

There's no reason not to admit I use anonymity networks. They certainly know that I do. And that's fine. The anonymity tools themselves aren't really possible to hide from things like deep packet inspection, right? They see you're connected to an anonymity network and transferring data, but if the encryption holds and you're using software and an OS that are not spying, that should be all they know. They see encrypted junk.

Mullvad has a tool called DAITA that claims it can fight DPI by inserting padding at odd intervals. This will slow down your connection. It may work, it may not. 

The US government is very paranoid and it funds ""internal security"" better than the welfare system because it's done playing nice and now all they have are threats.

Realize that if your threat model is a very well funded nation state adversary and it's one where you live, and you are a citizen, and they can send goons for you whenever they feel like it, you've lost already. Anonymity networks are mostly for when your threat model might be a local government or a copyright troll or something. Even then, not a guarantee.

The heightened state of paranoia and aggressive posture are happening because the government doesn't want to represent its citizens anymore and so it just threatens to hurt you if it does not like you.

The situation is rapidly destabilizing, and a lot of that is because of mass unemployment, hyperinflation, the erosion of the US dollar, and the price of many essentials of daily life doubling in price in only a month because of Trump's tariffs."

""Yes, the claim in the image you provided is accurate. The Trump administration has effectively dismantled the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, along with other oversight offices. Over 100 staff members from these offices have been placed on administrative leave and are expected to be formally terminated in May. These offices were responsible for monitoring and investigating civil rights issues within DHS, including those related to immigration enforcement and detention conditions. 

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stated that these offices ""have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS's mission,"" suggesting that their removal is intended to streamline operations. 

Critics argue that eliminating these oversight bodies reduces transparency and accountability, particularly concerning the treatment of immigrants and the enforcement of civil rights within DHS operations."""

Did your workload change significantly when Biden began his migrant parole policies? My understanding from reading a few GAO reports is USCIS got bogged down in a lot of work for applicants that fell into categories that are exempt from fees, and since the agency is supposed to be self-funding, it created some additional backlogs on top of an already strained system.

At this point, I'm assuming the Trump administration proceeded to obliterate the agency's ability to get ahead of any backlog."

I consider myself lucky as I got my GC a littler over 2yrs ago but I always remained a reader of this subreddit. And while I was reading your post, a shiver went down my spine. the following struck me while reading, it seems to me that the USCIS is one of the very few agencies where the administration actually and technically could care less if it worked well and efficiently or totally unorganized and extremely slow. And that thought scares the crap out of me. As it seems one way for this admin to shut down legal immigration is to severely mistreat USCIS agency employees and hope for folks to totally lose
Morale and preferably quit. Bc so what I don’t have enough ppl to process stuff, cause we don’t want immigrants anyway? So let this agency be as bad as they want, it’ll only result in fewer cases being approved. And the less get approval the happier those folks seem to be..
Am I wrong in my thought and worry? 
Stay strong everyone. I wish you all nothing but the best. Be kind to yourself and practice self care during a time of uncertainty and having no way of getting any insight on your case it is important to not suffer any mental illnesses that

Having spent 20 years in the U.S. closely observing immigration policies, I’m not an advocate but often help people with counseling and Q&A.

In my view, he will likely address birthright citizenship, although this would likely face challenges in the courts. I also expect a renewed travel ban targeting certain Muslim-majority countries. The biggest shift may come from halting or significantly reducing asylum petitions, which would resonate strongly with his base.

Regarding deportation, I think the numbers will remain consistent with past administrations. For example, Obama a Democrat had the highest deportation rate, while Trump’s numbers were around average compared to other presidents. The media will likely create some public alarm, and influencers, YouTubers, and lawyers may jump on this trend to gain attention or profit."

All that being said, yes people need to chill, need to read official sources, and also be less paranoid. If it seem too radical, it's not happening. If it does happen, expect retaliation that would eventually revert it.

1gpo7nf,lwsfw5y,u/Aggravating-Pen5968,2024-11-12T18:44:46+00:00,9,"Just a quick reminder: some thousands of US citizens (born or naturalized) get mistakenly deported every year from the USA. Others get to spend months in immigration jail awaiting to be deported. Of course, most (if not all) have returned, but I don't think anyone would want that to happen to them.

There are many reasons for this to happen (besides racism and xenophobia, of course). One reason is that cases in immigration court have very little time to solve things. Also, ICE officials don't do their job of verifying if you're a citizen or not, sometimes they don't even check your ID or social security. Sometimes they (and even some judges) claim that your US birth certificate is not real.

It is crazy to learn that there is no comprehensive database of US citizens, nor is there one sole way to prove citizenship, explained Laura Murray-Tjan, director of the Federal Immigration Appeals Project, which bills itself on its site as “the law firm dedicated to immigrants’ rights.” An individual can either apply through US Citizenship and Immigration Services, assert his citizenship in immigration court, or apply for a US passport — and there are constantly evolving laws that determine an individual’s eligibility, she said. Officials often lack the necessary time to examine each case, particularly in immigration court.

I can only pray and hope that the next president finds it hard to start anything of this sort (since mass deportations would affect his pockets and the economy overall). 🙏🏻

I have been under immigration status for over 10 years and have been under all sort of different types of visas. Luckily for me, I have been always a legal immigrant so nothing bad happens for me. Having said that, I have been through immigration process under the first Trump administration and it was certainly more difficult and sluggish compared to other times. I expect more scrutiny on immigration proccesses under the next administration but that's to be expected given the hawkish view from their policy standpoint. That's all we should be prepared for. Any policy changes and rulings that may impact any specific types of immigrants remain to be seen.

US is still a country of the laws. Any changes in administration policy have to go through public review process so we are all gonnna know about. Any further changes are gonna be from law changes which will have to go through Congress. Any attempts to skirt the laws from the administration will meet with legal actions that will require going through the courts (federal/supreme). So all and all, nothing is gonna change overnight and if there are changes, they are gonna take some time. If it comes down to that, we are all gonna have time to prepare and adjust to those changes. Any kind of premature and unsubstantiated rumors are simply useless. You are worrying about things that are not in existent and frankly you have no control over. Why doing that? It's stressful enough to be an adult so let not add any unnecessary stresses to your life on rumor mill.

My 2 cents is to expect more scrutiny from USCIS and being on the lookout for any news regarding immigration policies and get yourself informed on those. Anything else, ignore them and carry on with your life. Life is too short to worry about rumors and speculation."

1gpo7nf,lws34jw,u/Opening_Broccoli_989,2024-11-12T17:39:57+00:00,1,"I'm not worried for my internationally adopted DD but  the concern is a good wake-up call to ensure her documents are secured.  For example, it's not clear to me whether an old (more than 15 years since issuance) passport is proof of citizenship.  Either there's been a chance in the regs or everyone is confused!

Her citizenship is derived from me.  There is a long chain of documents needed for her to prove that citizenship.  This mailing back and forth of original documents for replacement passports etc. had me nervous before.   Any loss in the mail would be devastating. 

I went the extra mile years ago and gave her the security of having all possible docs:  readopted in the United States, paid $$$ for a Certificate of Citizenship.  

It's never a good idea to have the documents stored in one place (now in a small home fire safe).  Plan to again rent a bank safetydeposit box.  

She's ethnically Chinese and if US-Chinese relationships go bad, there could e a case made that all Chinese adoptions were fraudulent (due to how the paperwork was done there, long story).

Is that going to happen?  No.  Do I want my daughter's future life potentially controlled by the likes of a Stephen Miller:  No, and ick."

The fact is Trump isn’t going to be immigrant friendly but if you’re law abiding you likely have less to worry about."
1gpo7nf,lwss67l,u/Equivalent_Ad_8413,2024-11-12T19:47:15+00:00,1,"Think about Trump's priorities.  First, he will go after illegal immigrants involved in crime.  Then he will go after illegal immigrants in general since (by definition) they are criminals.

These two priorities, by themselves, will easily take more than four years.  Chasing down eleven or more million people is going to take a crap ton of money and a crap ton of people.  Then come the Dreamers and the legally admitted refugees.

While in an ideal MAGA world, removing citizenship status from undesirables might be a goal, the reality is that there are many people in this country who are a higher priority to remove.

Ask again in four years when the next MAGA President is elected.  And look at how many people Trump was able to deport during those four years.  With that information, you'll be able to at least estimate when they get around to you.  (And with luck, MAGA will have burned itself out by the next Presidential election.  Who knows, the GOP might have lost the House after only two years.)"

To help you understand how I’m feeling, just try this little exercise:  Every time a Trump official or MAGA supporter makes a statement about immigrants, substitute the word “Jew” for the word “immigrant” and see if it aligns with fascist statements of the 1930’s. 

You will recall that Jews who were citizens of Germany, were rounded up and deported or placed in concentration camps in Germany and Poland and either worked to death or gassed (along with 3 million “mental defectives”, Gypsies, homosexuals, communists and other “degenerates”.) And after 1941, American born Japanese were rounded up and placed in US concentration camps.

Maybe at the very most chance, only of criminals. It takes a massive amount of resources to pull off any of this deportation, and especially at the levels people are fearful it will be at. Criminals, yes. We start there. Stopping incoming illegal entry at the border—we continue with that. Only then, if any time, money, manpower, and resources are left, might other groups be examined. I could be wrong, but I don’t see agents even knocking on doors and checking papers or checkpoints other than near the border or in border states. Only in the wildest hyper fear mongering imagery painted by people 1000% against Trump or can I imagine ICE agents raiding schools and ripping undocumented kids out of their seats. 
There are just so many layers and so many moving parts.

2. Does your level of education, (like masters or PhD) affect or improve your rank in the army?

Here is my take: as lpr and petitioning for your dad puts him on a preference cat this is why he has to get 601a, if the wife were a USC that waiver would not be necessary because it can be exempted. If the wife were to naturalized he is put on a IR category so he would not have to do consular processing. This could been a defense in his removal proceedings. But the fact that he was picked up while working with no authorization thats one of the violation of his visa term on top of his overstay. But if why was a Citizen this is also exempt.

It’ll start with people like your father and it’ll eventually extend to citizens who speak up around things the republicans deem “terroristic”. So sorry you are dealing with this. It sounds like your father was hard working and raised a good family. Sending you best wishes.

I understand not understanding the process because I had married someone here on a student visa not realizing there were extra steps but we realized within a few months and started the process. "
1jkk6h0,mprn2cf,u/Ok_Economist3667,2025-04-30T01:40:43+00:00,1,"Hey OP, its been a month later, any updates? My boyfriend was recently detained by ICE even though he has a work permit and a pending asylum case. Its been nearly impossible to get any information on what is going on and on contacting him. He told us in a call that he chose to have a court hearing on May 28th, but no court case is in the system with his A number still even though its been days. Do you think maybe it takes weeks for the case to be in the system? I am also curious if your dad has been released. I am so sorry you are going through that. If anyone has any information that can help me as well, I greatly appreciate it. "

She had a bond hearing in Georgia but then was moved to Texas a week to her bond hearing. Georgia judge said he didn’t have jurisdiction during the bond hearing and now we are waiting for her case to reflect on Texas so we schedule another bond hearing. It has been really hard for our families and I can’t even imagine how yours feels as well. One question I have is, how long did it take for his case to be moved from Massachusetts to Texas ?"

I’ve often wondered how does USCIS staff determine whether an asylum case is genuine. I’ve seen numerous videos and social media posts where people discuss applying for asylum by fabricating their reasons or submitting fake evidence of threats to their lives.

Additionally, what happens to asylum seekers who travel through several countries (sometimes 3 or more) before applying for asylum in the U.S.? Are their cases automatically rejected because they had the opportunity to seek asylum in one of those countries, where they could live safely, but chose instead to come to the U.S.?

I’m just curious because we don’t often have the chance to ask USCIS staff these kinds of questions. Any insights or experiences you could share would be incredibly helpful."

I am US citizen, my spouse filed asylum around 2016, then we met each other fell in love and got married. Applied AOS, i-130 approved but i-485 denied because of C1 status. Now the only route is the pending asylum. I hear that it gets immediate rejection in the asylum interview because of C1 status. Idk how true is that. Now with the new administration, we live in fear. We have a kid. We don’t want to get deported. What kind of questions are asked generally during the interviews? Can spouse and kid also appear in the interview together?"

I’m on a pending asylum case and waiting to be interviewed, so this relaxes me a lot 🫶 a lot of us (immigrants) have heard the narrative that people who work at USCIS  are “bad”, “racist” or “want deport people without hearing their cases”… so hearing that in reality y’all are worried and *do* care about people who seek asylum is an amazing thing."

This corresponds to everything I’ve seen at USCIS (and INS before that; I’ve been around a long time.) Yes, there are bad apples, but most officers care deeply about *helping* immigrants start new lives in America. 

Thanks for everything, USCIS!"

She gave me a big smile and told me to go start the rest of the process so I could someday become a citizen. It was a 30 second exchange, one of many for her, but a core memory to look back fondly on for me.

I will get on my own soapbox now and say something to liberals and leftists: laughing at, celebrating, or saying you have no sympathy for random Latino people facing deportation because ""Latinos voted for Trump"" is disgusting. Reporting random Latino people you know to ICE and encouraging other people to do so is even more disgusting. 

Yes, more Latino citizens than usual voted for Trump in 2024. However, not all of them did, not even the majority of them did, and the Latino people facing deportation are not the people who voted for Trump.
Hell, even if the majority of Latino citizens did vote for Trump, that still wouldn't make it okay to laugh at or celebrate bad things happening to random Latino people when you don't know who they voted for. And by the way, you know which racial group did have a majority of voters who voted for Trump? White Americans. 

Denigrating any random person of a racial and ethnic group on the basis that some people (again, not even a majority) of citizens who are that ethnicity voted for Trump is bigoted. It just is. Liberals and leftists who do this really need to stop doing the James Somerton thing and cloaking their bigotry in vaguely progressive sounding talking points to make their bigotry sound progressive."

1ipk8wn,mct8cnd,u/mrdaemonfc,2025-02-14T22:48:13+00:00,3,"ICE will honestly be working on illegal immigrants at full capacity forever. At the rate they're moving, they'd only arrest about 1.2 million or so of them (about 8%) over 4 years.

Even if you want rid of them, you'll never get them all. It's plausible that they'll ""take operational control of the border"" and prevent the problem from getting much worse and make progress, but I'd expect that 90% of the illegal immigrants, or more, will still be here in four years.

ICE just hasn't had that much luck. Like most police, their major success stories are in ""catching the stupid ones"". Of course some will also be ""unlucky"".

My advice would be if you don't have your papers, don't hang around anyone who you have reason to believe is a criminal or has been ordered removed. If they catch you it'll likely be while you're hanging out with them."

But once they settle in, get a job, and find a place to live, they suddenly start turning against others who are just starting out like they once were. They refuse to help, start talking badly about those in need—like saying, ""This guy asked to stay for the night; he should just get a job like the rest of us""—and even adopt anti-immigrant views, supporting policies like Trump's.

To me, that’s something I’ll never understand."

The issue here is, illegal immigrants have become entitled to being here. Yes, some are working and paying taxes. Some are non-violent and respect the laws.

1ipk8wn,mcwj3xe,u/beandango,2025-02-15T14:16:20+00:00,3,"Well said. I’m very fortunate to have been able to get my husband his green card right before all this shit hit the fan, but it is a constant growing fear in the back of my head that at any point, the target could change. At any point the maniacs in the Oval Office could move the goalposts, change their definition of “the evil within”. Scoffing at or condemning other human beings thinking you’re “better than them” because you went through a prohibitively expensive and LONG process won’t grant you any immunity when this happens. You’ll just be a gullible fool. 

My mother is now a us citizen who got here in the early 2000s from the same country my husbands from. She has this mentality that the immigrants coming in now are ruining the country… but somehow I guess she was okay with my husband coming over, and even seriously suggested he try flying to Mexico to cross the border when we were just starting the I-130 process. So… these people *are* okay with human beings coming over in any way necessary to improve their lives… but only if it’s them and their family. All the other people are “bad”. I just don’t get how these people don’t hear themselves. 

The best we can do is to *not* do this. To extend basic human empathy and grace for eachother instead of more division."

Greed, power trips, stepping on others just to climb higher—it's all just ignorance wrapped in ego. But here’s the thing: no one escapes their own energy. Karma moves like the tide—what you send out, you’re gonna get back, one way or another.

Yeah, it’s frustrating as hell watching the system chew people up, watching good souls get trampled. But even they have their own paths, their own lessons to walk through. All we can do is stay true, keep our hearts clean, and trust that the universe balances all debts. The storm always circles back."

It simply isnt reasonable to expect that and the US Citizenry have made that perfectly clear by electing the current president. Some of these border crossers have proven to be hardened criminals and the impact of illegal activity those criminals have had on the population cannot be tolerated.

At any rate, Part 14, questions 12 and 13 of the DS-160 form anyone applying for a visa to enter the US has to fill out ask ""Do you seek to engage in terrorist activities while in the US or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities?"" and ""Have you ever or do you intend to provide financial assistance or other support to terrorists or terrorist organizations?"" and you have to answer ""no"".

1ji9lcj,mjien6l,u/pinkteacup21,2025-03-24T17:27:33+00:00,5,180 days unless you qualify for equitable tolling or sua sponte/discretionary reopening.
1ji9lcj,mje5y0m,u/Sensitive-Tourist511,2025-03-23T23:25:30+00:00,6,"Originally when she was a kid yea, but for all this process, no"
1ji9lcj,mjdyr11,u/Sensitive-Tourist511,2025-03-23T22:45:56+00:00,16,"My wife better at this than me i just pay for it😂😂😂….we filed whatever it was to get the deportation removed, it got rejected, we refiled like an appeal i guess? And by this time my wife got her GC so the lawyer added that, and used my veteran status for a parole in place, and we just found out a couple days ago the deportation order was terminated and we can now go ahead and file the petition and all that stuff now"
1ji9lcj,mjjmlnk,u/Low_Guest5516,2025-03-24T20:57:09+00:00,1,My husbands military PIP was denied. Is true DHS not doing the motion to dismiss at this time?
1ji9lcj,mywjmwm,u/AbbreviationsDue4178,2025-06-20T23:53:40+00:00,1,Trump does unfortunately
1ji9lcj,mje11ej,u/Sensitive-Tourist511,2025-03-23T22:58:25+00:00,3,She never left the usa
1ji9lcj,mjexnxi,u/iamkumaradarsh,2025-03-24T02:10:31+00:00,2,not now bcz court got envolved in it
1ji9lcj,mjkb5z7,u/Sensitive-Tourist511,2025-03-24T23:05:27+00:00,1,Texas
1ji9lcj,mjtynes,u/Sensitive-Tourist511,2025-03-26T13:44:25+00:00,1,"The 1st time we tried to get my stepdaughters removal order taken away it was denied….so this 2nd time around, my wife had gotten her 10yr green card so the lawyer used that to our advantage(not entirely sure what he did) but also said that because we have been married long before my stepdaughter became 21 we could also use the parole in place for my stepdaughter since i am a veteran….and yea paid the man, they filed the paperwork and a couple months later the removal order was removed and we r good to move forward with the everything we gotta do to file the necessary documents to get her papers"
1ji9lcj,mjqm6gz,u/Irregularblob,2025-03-25T22:46:19+00:00,1,Really just shows you have no idea how the immigration process works at all if you cant find a perspective of someone like this.
1ji9lcj,mjfhydv,u/mrdaemonfc,2025-03-24T04:35:28+00:00,15,Meanwhile this OP has 382 karma on the post in the past 7 hours.
1ji9lcj,mjjibby,u/romashka715,2025-03-24T20:37:13+00:00,4,I dont think Reddit is anti positive. I think people just come here to look for solutions to problems. Rarely who posts positive happy stories like OP.
1ji9lcj,mjzobvd,u/Leading_Tax_8067,2025-03-27T10:54:32+00:00,1,"Hi, I see you outdoors"
1ji9lcj,mje4hi2,u/JBSHV,2025-03-23T23:17:24+00:00,4,"Well the reason I ask is because, don't they do deportations pretty quick, and I didn't know you could file to terminate a removal, I'm trying to come up with plans to protect my bff who is on DACA, in case they try to ever come after her, that's why I ask for details."
1ji9lcj,mkfthpd,u/Automatic-Smell-5971,2025-03-29T23:55:43+00:00,1,There are a lot of factors to consider when denying military PIP. I would look into having a conversation with an attorney because there maybe things that are not being told .
1ji9lcj,mk8h1s6,u/Resident_Yesterday82,2025-03-28T19:15:43+00:00,1,"No shit. Why do you think I asked them? For almost 25 yrs I’ve helped the kids of illegals.  Food, school clothes etc and in all that time I’ve never met 1 person that wanted their citizenship.  The parents also didn’t use their real names and most of them confided they have a record. But I don’t blame a kid for their parents screw ups.   Still, I would like to know the answer.   Aside from running their scams in a place where they have a wealthier customer base it doesn’t make sense."
1ji9lcj,mjebd8f,u/Rosamada,2025-03-23T23:55:59+00:00,15,"They do deportations pretty quickly if the person subject to the removal order is in ICE custody, but there are tons of people with active removal orders who are not in ICE custody. ICE historically hasn't hunted these people down to deport them; if they don't cross paths with ICE/law enforcement, they can end up living the rest of their lives here.

It sounds like the removal order against OP's stepdaughter was issued years ago, but no one was actually planning to track her down and deport her. That's why OP was able to get the removal order suspended so many years later."
1ji9lcj,mjgk6sv,u/Psychological-Pea863,2025-03-24T11:11:22+00:00,3,I think it was probably because she wasn’t old enough to decide about her status
1ji9lcj,mjjlwgx,u/alkalinesurge,2025-03-24T20:53:48+00:00,0,And aren't almost all deportation orders appealable until the final unappealable order for removal?

1iz7f7o,mf0x3sh,u/Hizzort,2025-02-27T05:36:23+00:00,3,"Thanks so much! So the ceremony invitation said to “arrive” at 9am. The officer that I did my interview with said to arrive like half an hour before and I got there like 45 minutes before and the line to get inside the theater doors was like… 400 people deep(!)
Someone at the door verified the invite paper the went in a metal detector, then into another line, then another line and then another line 😅 I was seated in my assigned seat at like… 9:15? So not that long. Officially the ceremony started at 10am, done right around 11. 

And yeah there were passport stations there but the lines were so long (and I had already made an appt with my post office in advance so I skipped it). 

I did, however, register to vote then and there and it took, maaaaybe 4 minutes 😊"

1mbwb9n,n8xgwbd,u/Itinerary4LifeII,2025-08-16T00:31:47+00:00,1,"I never really thought these codes (like N400, DACA, 751s, NFB, AOS, etc.) were public knowledge. Where I work at it seemed like it was all supposed to be top secret. But, I guess, since those are the names of the documents then anyone dealing with them both inside or outside the office would know those code names.


I understand for some it's the difference between citizenship and no citizenship, and for others it's the difference between meeting metrics and being accurate and remaining employed or becoming unemployed and struggling. 


These documents are NO JOKE for the people who work on and process them. I think I'm already talking too much here even if I haven't revealed any job title or company name (no, USCIS doesn't magically do ALL of this stuff so flawlessly by themselves). It is so top secret that we weren't even told specifically what we'd be doing before our first day of orientation and had no idea that it would have any relation or similarities to USCIS. We absolutely had no idea it would have anything to do with immigration documents at all, especially considering the name of the company. I was thinking I would have my own cubicle doing some sort of data entry. Nope... All open space, and major security and cameras everywhere, to say the least."

1jfcbar,mirjm5l,u/TheAlamonian,2025-03-20T08:41:43+00:00,3,My understanding is that while at the border you’re not technically in the U.S. so the constitution doesn’t apply.
1jfcbar,miu4umi,u/CarobAffectionate582,2025-03-20T18:15:42+00:00,4,"Because it doesn’t fit the narrative.

Take the case of Fabian Schmidt a short while ago (German engineer denied entry in Boston). It took me less than a minute to find in public records that he skipped parole and fines in CA on drug and obstruction convictions.  Convictions, not charges (there was a jury trial).  Of course he was denied.

Did any, I mean ANY, media outlet report that, which was available in one minute of open internet searching?  Nah…"

The guy literally had confidential documents he took out of the country against his nda.  I have a close friend who I was super concerned about traveling here on a visa and as long as you’re not doing shady stuff it’s fine.   The US is open.  This and the Lebanese doctor with terroist ties was another conflagration.  She will go through due process but if I was border patrol I’d have come to the same conclusion.  

Follow the law and no one stops you.  I keep looking for the oddity.  The only thing I’ve seen that unfortunately is in accordance with law is that if your sex doesn’t match what you are claiming, then you’re denied entry such as the German couple story."

1jutrq1,mm59vaz,u/ice-titan,2025-04-09T02:24:47+00:00,14,"Some have suggested going the 485 route. Unfortunately, a 485 will not be of any use.  Those can take up to 2 years or longer these days, which is time you don't have, especially given your husband has an active deportation order.  

However, a 485 is moot in this case, as an illegal status was created by overstaying the previous visa, which makes the husband ineligible, and a 485 would get rejected anyway.  Perhaps you would be able to travel with him to his home country and sort things out from there.  Not ideal, but at least there would be solace and strength in that you would be together."

I understand that I may receive downvotes, but honestly, there are good people working at USCIS, and it shouldn’t be overlooked, regardless of which administration may be involved. While I have encountered horrendous treatment at some USCIS offices, where individuals were merely coming in for basic biometrics, I have also had truly positive experiences at other USCIS offices, where I was very impressed with the staff.

The reason I say that is I was born in the UK and married an American in the U.S. Air Force stationed in England.  Our first child was born in the UK in a local English hospital.  Her birth was registered in the UK and she was issued a British birth certificate but, since my then husband was a U.S. citizen, he registered her birth with the U.S. Embassy in London.  A few years ago she claimed dual citizenship by applying to the UK authorities for a British passport, also.  So she has two now - a U.S. one and a British one.  I believe your situation would basically be the same.  I expect your father registered  your birth at the U.S. Embassy in Germany shortly after you were born.  If you were born in a hospital on a U.S. base then they may well have done that automatically.  I think the form used is called something like a 'Notification of the Birth of a U.S. Citizen in a Foreign Country'......or some very similar form name."

I think that needs to be done before they turn 21yo (and there are other criteria, chiefly the parent they derive citizenship from must have lived a certain amount of time in the US prior to the child's birth).
If you got a US passport as a child, then it means that most likely your father did register you and that you're already a US citizen.

You need to file form N-565, it's the application for a replacement of your certificate of citizenship that your parents should have obtained by filing N-600.

If somehow they never got you a certificate of citizenship I think you will need to file N-600.
The evidence list is pretty extensive but one important required document is the CRBA.
You need to ask your parents to give you your CRBA (Consular Report of Birth Abroad) or file for a replacement of it with the US consulate that has jurisdiction over your place of birth.

You can also look into to what extent you can use your expired passport as proof of citizenship in renewing it.
DHS very likely has a record of all the passports it issued.

You should still get your certificate of citizenship anyway, though."

She’s been here since age 3 so nothing preventing her from being here.  I had a friend that her dad was from here but she was born in Mexico and she had to go though uscis to get her citizenship.  I hope this helps."
1lffmfb,myy179c,u/ExternalImmediate351,2025-06-21T06:07:50+00:00,1,"If you received a certificate of birth abroad.  My son was born in Korea when I was stationed there, and the certificate of birth abroad is his American birth certificate."
1lffmfb,myy2u1d,u/Summertyme_13,2025-06-21T06:23:05+00:00,1,Yes. As long as you didn’t make that passport yourself. lol
1lffmfb,myy2z6w,u/Summertyme_13,2025-06-21T06:24:27+00:00,1,You’re a citizen. You have an American parent. You were born on an American base. Go get your new passport ordered.
1lffmfb,myyddof,u/TryPuzzleheaded2702,2025-06-21T08:06:43+00:00,1,You are a U.S. CITIZEN and you just need to renew your passport
1lffmfb,myyzy8w,u/ChillnScott,2025-06-21T11:45:02+00:00,1,"Ha, U.S. just deported a guy with very similar circumstances. Crazy story: 

https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2025-06-04/texas-man-born-to-u-s-soldier-on-u-s-army-base-abroad-deported/"
1lffmfb,myzih3v,,2025-06-21T13:52:14+00:00,1,If possible ask your parents if they filed the paperwork to make you a citizen when you were born. But general rule of thumb for life if you have to ask the answer is probably no.
1lffmfb,myzxle6,u/QuailSubstantial9290,2025-06-21T15:16:38+00:00,1,Okay
1lffmfb,mz1muja,u/Same_Bug_7661,2025-06-21T20:44:06+00:00,1,"Yes, you are. If your birth was registered at the consulate, you should have a consular registration certificate. If you don’t have it, you can go to the embassy to obtain a copy. Additionally, an expired passport can serve as proof of U.S. citizenship. Since your dad was in the military, you may have different birth laws that apply to your situation Witch are more extensive."
1lffmfb,mz2bem7,u/Sufficient_Dance_767,2025-06-21T23:06:51+00:00,1,"Yes, only citizens can be in possession of an American passport."
1lffmfb,mz2fhko,u/TMTBIL64,2025-06-21T23:31:22+00:00,1,"I am pretty sure you cannot just renew that passport since it was a no fee and provided to you as a dependent of someone stationed abroad with the U.S. military.  Keep it, though as backup documentation, but I think you will have to do an application for a new passport and provide the required backup documents.  Did your father happen to get you a CRBA, which is a Consular Report of Birth Abroad?  It is done through the US consulates for US Citizens who acquire citizenship at birth abroad provided the US citizen parent did the paperwork and provided the backup documentation (and paid the fee) while they were, in your case, in Germany. Please contact the U.S. consulate closest to you to get an appointment to speak to a someone who can assist you with answering all your questions. Since you have had a US Passport  before, your Dad must have submitted documents to prove you were a  US citizen, but since you will most likely have to apply for a whole new passport and supply all the required documents, a CRBA, would make it a bit easier. Look up form DS 11. I believe that is the application form for a new passport. The instructions will tell you what you need to provide as backup documentation. Good luck. I hope it goes well for you."

1jnv5pt,mkn0dqs,u/James-the-Bond-one,2025-03-31T05:03:24+00:00,357,"If your mother was naturalized in 1974 and has an original Naturalization Certificate with a seal and photo, and has held multiple U.S. passports, she is a U.S. citizen. The USCIS “inability to verify” is a bureaucratic data problem, not a legal one. Most usually, her naturalization record has not been digitized.

The Texas DPS (which denied the license) should escalate the SAVE request internally. She should insist that they submit her case for manual secondary verification with DHS/USCIS.

In parallel, your mother should request a SAVE Case Resolution, which is how USCIS fixes this exact issue. The Texas DPS (Department of Public Safety) must give her a SAVE Case Number.

Once she has that number:

* Go to: [https://save.uscis.gov/casecheck/](https://save.uscis.gov/casecheck/)
* Input the number to track the status.
* If denied or delayed, she must submit her documents to DHS SAVE manually through a DHS Case Resolution Request.

If SAVE resolution fails, she can make an InfoPass appointment at the USCIS San Antonio Field Office"
1jnv5pt,mkmz6np,u/ameninaA,2025-03-31T04:53:00+00:00,148,sounds more like a dmv mistake

I feel for your mother, as I was also naturalized from Germany in the '70s. A few years ago, I needed my naturalization papers to obtain a REAL ID since my passport had expired.

Here is how I learned that the government agencies don’t always communicate with each other…
My family and I arrived from England in 1976. My mother received her nursing degree and the US placed ads at the nursing schools asking for nurses. My father was a mechanic for car and for the London tube..We received our Green cards and Social Security Numbers and cards. I went to Social Security when I was planning to become a US citizen and they told me that I had been working illegally for the previous five years. At that time, I have been working since I was 16 years old-legally. 

I had been here legally for many years. Thank goodness I was a hoarder and I had old alien cards with the dates on them to show the time and date of my entry into the US. I showed them to the Social Security administration agent and superintendent. I did not allow them to take them from mesince they were expired, but allowed them to make copies, I wanted to keep proof. 

I didn’t carry my citizenship papers with me, but luckily, I forced the Social Security administration to do some research and look up my status. Be aware that on the backs of your alien cards, are the dates of your legal entry into the US and your status!"

Senators have direct link to USCIS in the background that bypasses the normal channels. I had my whole case reopened in 4 days without having to go through the entire USCIS process just because my senator got involved. Then the office provided updates, every couple weeks or so, and constantly followed up until I had a rescheduled interview 6 months later

A republican senator by the way, and we were a gay couple, before any harpies chime in

Easy solution. Renew her passport and go in again. Besides as a USA naturalized citizen you should ALWAYS have a current passport.

In my opinion, it should be up to you to update their system. You have enough proof and evidence that she is a US citizen.  I went to a dmv once and was told I was not American even when I was showing my American passport because my birth country is from Latin America.  This also happens to Puerto Ricans a lot where staff assumes American citizens aren't American because of birth place."

1jnv5pt,mknoyym,u/Vtspook,2025-03-31T09:19:38+00:00,3,I am making an educated guess here but the stupidity probably is occurring because she naturalized when it was still done at the local court house and the authority had not been centralized with what is now USCIS. It is entirely dumb that this is your responsibility but I would obtain court certified copies of her file from the court house (I doubt they will give you the originals) along with a letter from the clerk of courts that states that her naturalization is on file with that court house. I then would write to USCIS requesting that they update their computer systems with her naturalization information providing the clerk letter and copies. As for DPS a new passport and certified copies of her naturalization  should be enough to satisfy them. As to her fear get her a passport card when she renews they she has proof of citizenship she can easily carry.

They believe that because he is married to you, a US citizen, that he’d want to stay in the US with you, live, work, and apply for adjustment and get a green while in the US, which is contradictory to a B2 visa that only allows him to visit and go home. 

He has demonstrated immigrant intent, possibly by the previous durations of stay.  Even if you had “proof” for ties, the situation alone warranting CBP’s suspicion suffices the visa revocation. This is not something you can challenge. CBP has the ultimate authority. I would assume that he was allowed to withdraw his admission by signing form I-275 and hopefully wasn’t served with an expedited removal carrying a 5 year bar instead, right? 


If he tries to get another B2 visa at the embassy again, while married to a US citizen, having had a visa revocation at the port of entry, as well as an entry denial, chances of the B2 visa denial are 100% so my advice, don’t even bother. 


The best you can do is just apply for a spousal immigrant visa by filing the I-130 petition and wait it out. He’s gonna have to wait outside the US and It’ll take 2-3 years, closer to 3 if in Juarez. He’s not coming to the US during that time. So unless you’re going back and forth to see him, you’ll be separated for a while. Good luck."

Technically, the visitor visa is not meant for living together. You need a Green Card for that and just because you never had problems before doesn’t mean what you and your husband were doing was legal. It just took until now for it to catch up with you. Sounds to me like it was a combination of the time until expiration (you said his visa expires later that month so he was maxing it out or was given a reduced admit until date and was close to hitting it) which is a red flag and secondly, you stating that you both cross regularly means he has a very long history of coming into and leaving the US, which can give suspicion of attempting to live in the US with intermittent trips abroad. You are also a USC spouse so the fact that you live in the US and he doesn’t, but “visits” you routinely and frequently was bound to get him flagged eventually. Only way around this is applying for a Green Card through Marriage."

Even if he has a multiple visa that says valid for  6 months each entry, doesn't mean he can go in and out anytime as he pleases. Rule of thumb is for every days/months of stay in the US, you should stay in your home country twice the amount of time you stayed inside USA. 

If he maximize his stay for 6 months, and leaves and comes back and stays another 6 months, that's red flag! You shouldn't maximise it, even if you were given 6mo. 

Im also thinking maybe for this year, he has already stayed more than 6 months (IN TOTAL of all his travels)   i know it dont make sense, but the thing is within a year you can only stay a total of 6 months or more or less 180days, even if he leaves, but if he keeps coming back, they probably added all the number of days he stayed.

But visas are simply the opposite. So many people overstay visas that the presumption is that someone is going to overstay unless they simply have so much going on at home that the consular officer feels like they will feel compelled to go. The scales have to be balanced. If he has a wife here, then he would have to have so much compelling him to go home afterwards would outweigh marital bliss. And that is a damn high burden to meet. If he had custody of children who were not coming, property ownership, a career that cannot be conducted in a supervisory capacity (think surgeon vs a business he can own without conducting day to day business) those are factors.

And when you cannot meet it, you get the 214b refusal/ revocation.

I know others have advised you of the same but I wanted to reinforce this- applying for an I-130 gets you around this. You no longer have the burden of proving he will go home after.

Others have recommended this as well, and I wanted to emphasize this- the sooner you consult with an immigration attorney, the better. Not only on the I-130 itself, but this: the accusation of working without an Employment Authorization Document is absolutely going to work against him, particularly with this administration. Previous administrations, D and R, have been realistic enough to say “folks gotta eat”.  This administration is going to be looking for an excuse to exclude people, and far flimsier excuses than that will suffice.

I work on immigration matters in a congressional office, and there has been a dramatic change since 1/21/25. This does not make me an immigration expert- there is a reason my advice is free and an attorney’s is not. They work on this full time while I have a dozen other issue areas where I need to keep, at the minimum, a glancing familiarity, and taxes take up a far greater portion of my time. They can take a case to court, and we can simply make requests of the administration, which almost always says no. These are bad times. Their interpretation of the law is so narrow, so exclusionary, that I have cases open for two surgeons who went back home on family matters and cannot get back into this country where they have lived and practiced for years.

I can stand on a soapbox for hours talking about this, and if no one stops me, I do. There is one significant legal change that can completely reform immigration law for the better, but it is not passing this Congress, so I might as well be making birthday wishes."

There are many good you tube videos on how to apply. He will not be allowed back in without applying for a green card from outside of the country. 

I was allowed back into the US as a visitor after being denied. I was denied because of lack of ties to Canada and we were not married at the time. Unfortunately, Canadians can be treated differently than Mexicans.

Your marriage is the evidence of intent.

US doesnt have dual intent (today I declare this and in the future I will do that). They infer the future intent. So you need to be really crystal clear about your intent when you cross, mentioning or implying no future intent.

So the difference is that CBP allowed me to enter and strongly suggested that leaving before I had a PR card would be problematic. They grilled me for 45mins and asked me the same question 8 times. The last time I stated ""I did not and do not intend to live in the United States"" the senior officer responded ""good answer"" and that was the end of the intervjew. Notice how I declared one thing and they nudged me toward another thing. This is confusing to some because it sounds like lying. The way things work in the US is very different from other western countries. Its not so much about honesty as it is about compliance.

So I ended up having to apply for a Green Card, and living in the US - which was never my plan. Especially now while America is figuring itself out. Especially because I need my Canadian healthcare. But I did get to learn some more about Americans and understand them better, which I appreciate.

Having the Green Card doesn't make me feel safe, though. It feels like the rules could change at any moment, which makes me very anxious. Even though I am not a target and have no criminality or social media exposure. So I don't know that this is a great time to move to the US, particularly for a Mexican national."

Prepare your case accordingly.  The fact that you were doing things the way you did show that you are not well-informed on these procedures.  The status adjustment can be denied if you fail to prove that you are in a bona-fide marriage and have all forms and evidence and all that you might be required to provide.  Right now, especially NOW, the administration is taking these cases extremely serious and it will not be taken lightly especially since you have this denied entry in record.

- stay within rolling 24 months exceeds a threshold"

Once it states overstayed, then thats all the proof to deny entry & revoke visa. It only takes one officer to notice it. Someone can stay the max 6 mos or even up to a year with approved extension. The thing is, even if someone departs the US a MINUTE/HOUR later, it will be flagged as an “overstay”. Example a visitor arrives at the airport at 1000 am PST Today, one must depart before/or by 1000am pst on January 11, 2026."

Did he leave the US after he went to Disney and then attempt a reentry? If so, then he did not make a “meaningful departure” and then it’s the officer’s discretion on what to do. If he has a BCC and violated the mileage restrictions or stayed in the US for more than 30 days at anytime previously without a valid I-94, he has violated the law and is subject visa/BCC revocation, expedited removal and a reentry bar. Food to think about.

I’m not sure how they scheduled this next part, but they gathered evidence about his employment in Mexico (his Mexican pay stubs, paper trails about his quality checks in the US) and once they presented it, his case went up to Washington DC where he was approved for the visa again.

I appreciate your honesty. I agree the best option so far is the green card through marriage. I understand visiting frequently can be suspicious. But I live right next to the border so it is easy to cross and vice versa. 

I guess I should have looked out for the flags earlier. But the officer insinuated he overstayed his visa which isn't true. His physical visa doesn't expire for years. The i94 does expire at the end of the month.

Would the officer not need stronger evidence to prove he lives (which he doesn't) in the US? Like physical evidence such as lease, bills, cards, etc?

He didn't violate the mileage since I live very close to the border. He has never stayed 30 days straight (not even close to that). He wasn't removed expedited or barred.

The crossing history only shows when someone crosses into the US, not into Mexico. So the officer wouldn't even be able to tell how many days he is spending in Mexico vs the US.

1ipxdtp,mdhr6oq,u/Cultural-Tofu,2025-02-18T20:35:20+00:00,1,"I’m stateless, been here since I was 9 years old, 27 years later, still here! At the age of 20, I lost everything I worked for during the short 2-years as an adult - lost my apartment, couldn’t attend college, and lost my job. All of this because my work permit was no longer eligible for renewal. I had no idea why. 

Fast forward 2 years later, I finally figured I had an order of deportation from 6 years prior. This is when I learned that my stay was temporary, I had no idea. I could’ve been more responsible, and I wish my family had educated more about my status in the US. However, after realizing, I was lucky enough to remain in the US without detainment with the help of lawyers, and I eventually received my work permit again. Life continues. 

What I said above is a reoccurring nightmare since atleast 2009. I can control a lot of things in life, what I can’t control are policies that affect us (such as Immigration). 

I don’t know what life would be like had I not been in this situation but what I do know is that it would be far less stressful. Do I wish to have lived in the alternate reality where my situation is more stable and am not an immigrant? NO! Do I wish things would finally stabilize? YES!

I’m rambling this because those that are going through this, take a moment and realize the strength we’ve created throughout this hardship. It’s shaped who we are. If I had not gone through all of this, my perception of immigration would perhaps be different. I’d like to think struggles have made me a better person. And I hope the same to you too!

Stay strong, hopefully my ramble helps. For now, let’s keep the hope alive, maybe by the end of this, we’ll all have more stability in what we call home, here."

Thanks for nothing but slapping us with police state news and threats, USCIS. Thinking we will get there someday and be able to be at peace, without the dreaded feeling of leaving and being apart for nearly another year, is somewhat hopeful, but its not even guaranteed if one dingus botches review of our case. I am fearful that my husband will become homeless because his government refuses to fix their injustices, and we decided to get married so we can legally start the process of enjoying our life together. Otherwise, our only option is to find some new country we can both live in together. Talk about a nightmare.

I don't disagree with what you say about the halts on life plans, job opportunities, and how detrimental it is on mental health, as well as on relationships. I hate what this process does to people.  Even if millions of us have been in the same shoes, our pain and suffering is different.  I've suffered abuse through this. Badgering and treated like a liar or criminal.  I, too, felt like a number, in a long line of numbers, and not a human being. It's not for the weak. Good luck, OP, even if you become a citizen, you will face other hardships.

I was born in the states but grew up in Mexico. And once I found out I was a US citizen(at 14), I ran like forest gump. I did not stop until I reached the border. And no, I am not an anchor baby jaja. My parents just wanted to go back to Mexico. They are also Chicanos (Mexican-American) but for some reason they made life in Mexico. 

It is truly the worlds greatest country in my eyes. The opportunities are just insane here. Obviously with hard work. That is key. Hard work in America will get you far. I love this country. For what it has given me and my family. 

Just be loyal and proud to be an American like we all should."

1k0onnv,mngij46,u/Objective_Western_74,2025-04-16T19:08:35+00:00,72,"Hi, 

My husband feels this way right now. Every day, he says things like, “I really want to work now,” and more. But since he doesn’t have a work permit yet and everything is still in process, he can’t. He left the U.S. because he had been waiting a long time for his green card and eventually decided to move here to Canada with me (we were in a long-distance relationship). Now, I’m sponsoring him.

As a wife supporting my husband right now, I always tell him, “It’s okay.” I won’t invalidate his feelings. Yes, he wants to work, and yes, it doesn’t feel good not being able to, but I want him to know that I’m okay taking care of him because he’s my husband.

He tells me that once he can work, he’ll buy me anything I want, that I won’t even need to check price tags before deciding if I want something. He says I’ll be able to order takeout whenever I’m too tired or lazy to cook. Right now, he doesn’t even care as much about the status of his permanent residency. He just wants to be able to help me.

I love my husband. I promised to take care of him. He already takes care of me in his own way, and I know that once he’s able, he’ll take care of me in the way he wants to.

As a wife, I know this is probably how your wife feels too. It can be hard sometimes, yes, but I’m sure she’s happy to be taking care of you. That’s what marriage is all about.


Hang in there and good luck, OP!"

Even though my husband kept reassuring me it was ok for him to function for 2 people, I could see that he saw me differently and the depression +  stress + helplessness + powerlessness actually contributed to the demise of our marriage. But now I am in a better position mentally and financially after the green card got approved (was exactly a year for me). Don't give up, you will come out stronger at the end of this. Good luck and I wish you the best."

While my wife and I don't have children yet, that's how my wife has to support me too as someone who also moved to the US on a K1 visa. I am in a similar situation that while I am fortunate enough to have had my i-765 approved already, getting a job has proved difficult.

You're tracking your case which is good, but I sure hope for your mental wellbeing that you're able to spend time not watching it constantly for an update. I'm sure helping your family in ways that don't cost money will hopefully make you feel productive and that you're contributing to your relationship. I would also advise you to work on your Resume and draft some cover letter templates so you're ready to start applying when you finally get your EAD.

I wish you and your family the very best of luck."

1k0onnv,mnjcrlm,u/IceColdBelow0,2025-04-17T05:18:26+00:00,2,"I was exactly where you are 3 years ago. I eventually got my work permit and green card soon after. I think I put an expedition request for my work permit. I’m not sure if I did it correctly, but I did get my work permit soon after. It took about 11 months for my work permit and 13 months for my green card. So look in to that if you haven’t already. 

On the other hand, I promise you it’s going to be okay. Don’t blame yourself. Just do the best you can, this situation is not your fault. Trust your partner. Not everything is about money. Until you can get your work permit, take care of your family by other means. I know it may suck, especially if you’re from a culture like me where the man is the provider, but I bet your wife will still appreciate you helping in other ways.

Also, find your community in your area. When you’re an immigrant, your community is the only support system you have. People you share a culture or religion with will be there to help. Make friends. Keep in touch with your friends back home. 

You’ll get through this. I believe in you. Stay strong for your family. This community will always be here for you. You’re not alone. I hope you get your work permit soon. I’ll keep you in my prayers. I wish you the best. Hope to see good news post from you soon."

1k0onnv,mnm7y6i,u/Aggressive-Search298,2025-04-17T17:14:41+00:00,2,"Hey brother, first—thank you for sharing your story. It takes strength to speak up when you're hurting, and just doing that already shows how solid of a man you are.

I want you to know this: you are not a burden. You've worked your whole life, and this moment doesn’t erase that. You're not weak—you’re in a system that moves painfully slow, but your fight, your love for your family, and your willingness to keep going are what make you strong.

Even without a work permit, there are things you can do right now to support your wife and start building something for your future:

Start a YouTube channel or blog. Share your story—there are so many others going through what you're going through, and your voice could help them feel less alone. Talk about your journey, immigration delays, being a father, mental health—anything that feels real. It could even grow into something you monetize later.

Learn a skill while you wait. Video editing, graphic design, blogging, social media management, coding—there are tons of free resources online (YouTube, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning). These skills can open doors the moment your work permit is approved.

Be present at home. Cook, care for your daughter, support your wife emotionally and physically. That is providing, even if it doesn’t come with a paycheck yet. Leadership comes in many forms.

Talk to your wife. Don’t carry the pain alone. You're a team, and she probably wants to help you carry the weight, not just the bills.

This situation is temporary, but your value is permanent. The work permit will come. In the meantime, you’re building something deeper than money—you’re building character, resilience, and a foundation your daughter will one day be proud of.

1k0onnv,mnmh5mv,u/Mindyourbusiness25,2025-04-17T17:58:03+00:00,2,Maybe sharing my story will make you feel better. I am your wife my husband received his GC right at the 1 year mark. He is now fully employed and I started a business. We made it through the 6 years and still going strong. Please hold on!! It will be worth it in the end. Keep in prayer. Sending light to you my brother.
1k0onnv,mnmk8do,u/BootzytheCat,2025-04-17T18:13:01+00:00,2,"We went through this. I supported my husband for nearly a year when he could not work legally. Marriage is about supporting each other. I also had to support him for another year when he was hit by a car through no fault of his own. There are things that are out of our control. Thankfully he is fully recovered from that life-threatening accident and now has a job where he makes more than I do. He struggled a lot with feeling useless during all of that time but is doing great now and loves his work. Hang in there and do not beat up on yourself. 

US immigration is a struggle that not many people understand unless they have been through it. Do try to focus on your mental health and self-esteem. Staying busy will help you with your self respect, even if you can only do volunteer work in your community. Try to keep pushing and expedite the work visa if possible."

Do NOT feel ashamed!!! This is just how things are right now. It won't be for forever. Things can change, or you can change your situation, location, etc. Keep remembering that the things that make you feel ashamed and depressed now could be completely different soon. Don't let this get you down.

I'm absolutely sure that your partner doesn't blame you. In my 30-year marriage there have been times when one of us supported the other, then vice versa. That's what marriage is."

You could consider contributing to the household in other ways, which you may already be doing. Getting up with the baby at night and doing her feeding, cleaning the house, making food, etc. can all be really valuable ways to contribute to your family and take some of the workload away from your wife.

The receipt you received from USCIS when you filed for AOS, along with your I94 should be valid proof. Also, if you have a license from your home county you are allowed to drive for 1 year from the date you entered the US. You don’t need an Indiana license from day 1. Of course, that doesn’t help now if you’ve been here more than a year.
You may also be able to get a SSN if you prove legal immigration status (again, your receipts along with I94 should work)."

If you are going to follow the immigration process, dodging whatever the government has to confront you with is the opposite of your intentions and will not end well. 


I would get options from my lawyer but keep my apointment and get your bio done. If it is a trap my lawyer is aware and i can contest it in court. If it isn't i only wasted a little more money dealing with my lawyer on this issue and i am continuing in the process. Either way I would have pursued the process,  legally.




Maybe it was normal government being unorganized,  incompetent government."

Because what you are missing is that some of this is comparable to like the cops pulling everyone over for going a few miles over the speed limit.  Would you be okay with that?  After all they broke the law, right?

And Trump broke the law many times and was indicted for 91 felony counts — has he paid for it?  Does Trump getting away with law breaking bother you?  He’s gotten away with supporting an actual attack on the US Capitol and Congress, and trying to steal an election. That’s way worse than any of this immigration stuff.  Or does the law not apply to Trump in your world?  But only to some people trying to make a life and become US citizens?

There is always discretion in the law.  And Trump said “bad criminals” would be deported, not people trying to follow the rules.  So maybe qualify, edit or delete your post, cause it’s not worth the electrons."

Also, you’re doing biometrics for the I-485, not really the I-130.

Sometimes the petitioner can be asked to do  biometrics on the I-130 if they suspect that the petitioner is involved in some sort of Walsh Act crime.

OP got their answer: the I-485 was denied because the I-130 is denied. There is no point to leave this open for people to speculate about misrepresentation and immigrant intent when that's not what the denial notice is for. Thread locked.

The easiest way to make sure all of your ducks are in a row is to research how to apply for these visas and make sure you follow them correctly and in the correct order. As soon as you were engaged you should’ve filed for the K1 visa, this doesn’t stop your ability to visit America completely, tourist visas can still be issued and you wouldn’t have been separated the entire time waiting for a K1 approval. 

Without seeing the I-130 rejection it’s hard to say, but my interpretation would be that she entered the USA under false pretenses and that’s why she’s been rejected. You kinda just can’t do that. You have prior evidence to prove your relationship was ongoing before she entered the USA. So even though “millions of people” get married on a tourist visa, they usually do it with people they’ve fell in love with while being inside the USA. Not people they’ve already been in a relationship with or engaged to.

If during her tourist visa application and the embassy interview she lied and said she was coming to see California as a tourist as opposed to be with you that’s a big problem. She OBVIOUSLY lied during her visa application (otherwise she would be denied tourist visa) and it came up during the interview with USCIS. All the documents that she compiled to prove that your marriage was legitimate (!!!!!!AND THE ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE SHE APPLIED FOR TOURIST VISA BUT NOT DISCLOSED DURING VISA APPLICATION !!!!!!) she was so meticulous about collecting was actually also evidence of tourist visa fraud that she committed when entering the US if she failed to disclose that she was coming to you."

Reasons for denial could include missing or incorrect information on the I-130, such as a typo in a name or date of birth, missing birth certificate, an invalid or untranslated birth certificate, missing marriage certificate if it was required, or a request for evidence (RFE) that was delivered to the wrong address or never answered on time. The denial notice will tell you exactly what went wrong.

At this point, you MUST retain an immigration lawyer to help you figure out whether you should file a motion to reopen or refile the I-130 completely. Filing again is often easier, faster, and usually your best bet if the error is something simple to fix. A lawyer can also check if you qualify for an appeal or motion to reconsider, depending on why it was denied.

Gather all your original documents, the denial notice, any RFEs you received, and proof that you did or didn’t respond. Take these to your lawyer so you can act quickly and not miss any deadlines. Hurry!"

This indicates USCIS thinks there’s been an unlawful entry. Other wording (INA 235a3) suggest that I130 is/ was denied. 

Combine the two things here and it can be assumed that USCIS assumes your wife used her tourist visa to gain entry for the purpose of adjusting status; which violates the terms of the tourist visa and makes her inadmissible for 485.

Seek help from an attorney as soon as possible and ask them to help you file a motion (form I-290B).

Remember, it said ""USCIS my issue you a Notice to Appear ..."" not ""USCIS will issue ..."". My mom received this before and we did file the I-290B and she filed another I-485 later (we filed that because there might not be any removal proceedings while you're waiting for the result of your motion). Now my mom is a permanent resident, her US citizen husband petitioned her and she's been in the US the whole time. Please both of you don't panic and immidiately find an attorney to help, you don't have to self-deport right away. Believe me because we were in the same boat, receive this same letter with that same cruel ""within 33 days"" words. USCIS works according to the law, and we have to understand and follow that, so just stay calm and resolve it. Wish you all the best!!"

Tourist visas are for temporary visits. If she didnt disclose her relationship with you when she entered as a tourist she misrepresented her intent to immigration officers at entry. It may be worth contacting a lawyer, and she probably will need to leave the country under this administration especially. The good news is there likely is a way for her to eventually return with the right paperwork and Mexico is a beautiful country if you move with her and your daughter.  The legal way to do what you guys did would have been to use the K1 visa if you wanted to marry in the US or marry and then file CR1. Both require her to wait outside the US while waiting for the visa. There are people who spontaneously decide to marry while on tourist visas and get approved for the 485, but its always a risk and it relies on that person not having intent to marry when they entered (and your engagement kind of eliminates that as a possibility. "

my mom got married over 18 months ago and 3 months after her marriage they filed for her adjustment. All was smooth and she got the interview and all went good. She came with a Tourist visa in 2010.
In 2016 my grandma petitioned her, back then my mom was just meeting my stepdad. 
Grandma died in July of 2020 and in Nov of 2020 USCIS  send my grandma a letter for additional evidence, grandma already dead by this moment. Checked with attorneys and they said there was nothing left to do with that case since grandma died.
Now a month ago, my mom received a letter to show up to court to begin her removal proceedings, but at the same time she already had her interview  in Dec of 2024… 
She checked with her attorney and even he is confused with the whole situation….

OK, in reading your replies. You might be cooked. Basically you committed visa fraud. She entered the US on a tourist visa with the intent to get married; meaning she lied to the US government on her visa application. You needed to file for a K1 (Fiancé visa). Basically, you provided proof to USCIS that your wife lied and obtained a visa under false pretenses. 

You need to immediately speak to your attorney, as this could easily result in a ban from re-entry.  They are really the only ones that can tell you what you need to do, but need to be prepared that you may need to depart the US, go back to Mexico and figure it out from there."

Esp under the current administration who is under the ass of everyone with a visa or in process of immigrating .

Keep it simple if you have a good relationship with significant other 
Visit often and then marry overseas and have a reasonable ceremony and register ur marriage and get a marriage certificate with proper authenticity and attested and have all events and evidences in a file 
And file -130 us citizen and wait for 1/1.5 years for the whole process 
It’s easy pathway and person coming to USA can start working and doing stuff almost immediately 
Questions?

Google - Visa journey join the community and post ur concerns u will understand the whole processes 

K-1 fastest way to get here
Legalizing takes a while for the other due to have to get Marry within 90 days 

Having any other visa other Than these two and getting married and then adjusting 
Is subject to scrutiny and a hassle 

Please look into differences Between k1 and cr1 
Visa and then decide pathway to get ur significant other to USA properly and legally

They only way it could conceivably happen is if SCOTUS somehow reinterpreted the 14th Amendment. But that would mean that ***nobody*** who had been considered a citizen under the 14th Amendment had ever been one.

How do native-born Americans prove their citizenship now? Easy: just show your U.S. birth certificate. Without birthright citizenship, that wouldn’t be enough. You’d have to prove your parents were U.S. citizens. But how? ***They*** only had their U.S. birth certificates!

Bottom line: Americans who descend from people in the U.S. since the 1860s couldn’t prove they were citizens. Like, at all.

Again, think about this: Everyone’s citizenship now rests on a U.S. birth certificate or a certificate of naturalization. Take away birthright citizenship, and only naturalized folks are citizens. Good luck with that!"

No, this isn’t ok. It’s not even about daisy chaining old mom & dad in, it’s about being realistic."

Tuesday, I had literally zero idea who this guy was, I still have zero idea what his politics are, why is he so significant, it’s not like it was Obama or Trump, or dozens of other high profile political people I could name, isn’t he a YouTuber?

1.) USCIS should have excluded Green Card holders as recipients, as that status would override the previous parole anyway.

2.) The wording is confusing and there's a lack of coherence in the letter's message.

A greencard may expire, the card itself, but unless it’s a conditional greencard, the person is still a greencard holder. Parole, if it expires you simply got nothing. No parole= no status. Being on parole means they were allowed entry into the U.S. for a Temporary period under specific conditions, but it does not grant them lawful permanent resident status or the rights of a green card holder.

All they are doing is notifying this person that the program they were under has been terminated and they have from now until April 24th to get their affairs in order and leave the country on their own, as that is the day their employment authorization will also come to an end. If this person lets say was married to a USC or even a greencard holder and submitted forms from now until then, they wouldn’t have to leave by April 24th but they still would have to wait to regain work authorization. 

It is very straight forward and something they’ve been saying would happen. Not like being ambushed at an airport randomly and asked to sign a relinquishment of one’s greencard for no reason, now that’s getting someone off guard. Is it right to just terminate programs and completely disregard their expiration dates? No. But unfortunately that’s where we’re at."

1nm9tth,nfdtard,u/kmoonster,2025-09-21T07:47:13+00:00,5,"Take this with a grain of salt.

What Trump says, what the EO author writes, what staffers say (Lutnick in this case), and what Levitt says? Often four entirely different, sometimes contradictory things.

The published text of the EO is at the White House website and, for now, is the document you have to read/analyze if a work-related visa relates to you or an instance that you are trying to figure out (eg. for an employee, roommate, etc). The EO can be read here: [Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers – The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/)

What Trump (or staffers) say in spoken words does not over-ride the written text, and the written text is what the agencies will be held to if a case is contested. If the spoken statements (or Twitter statements, etc) contradict each other or the text of the actual order, the actual EO is all that matters; anything else is just Trump & co. failing to understand the order they themselves are promoting.

  
Also: note that this will all but certainly be contested in court, likely immediately, which will only add to the confusion/conflict as the EO author, the agencies affected, and the court order are likely to disagree on intention and impact. Consulting a good, knowledgeable lawyer is the answer to any and all questions that will inevitably arise."

I am currently employed as a System Programmer under F-1 STEM OPT status.
I have an upcoming personal trip to India, departing the US on September 23, 2025 (Tuesday), and returning on October 30, 2025. 

This trip is purely personal and does not involve any visa stamping, renewal, or status change processes. For reference, my F-1 visa remains valid until May 2027, and my EAD is valid until January 2027.

I have obtained authorization from my company to travel and work remotely from India for the duration of the two-week period.

Given the recent White House proclamation on H-1B visas, I wanted to confirm whether this will pose any issues for my re-entry to the US upon return.

Your guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated."

Wait, what? USCIS sat on your N-400 for 9½ months!? My wife and I filed our N400s just a couple of months before you — and could have been citizens in the spring/summer. (We had to reschedule one appointment each and were ultimately sworn in in August and October, respectively.)

Also, congrats and [welcome home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6grAoS-muM&t=859s)!

When I answered the questions on page 4, there is a part it says “signed at city and state” and I put the town of where I live instead of the town where the ceremony will take place. Do you think it’s an issue? The ceremony will take place in Central Islip but I wrote Lake Grove which is where I live. I put the ceremony’s date as it mentioned on page 1 but I think I should have written Central Islip. Did you see anyone having an issue with that while you were there? Thanks again.

1gl09pe,lvq64br,u/galaxybear459,2024-11-06T15:35:53+00:00,199,"It's really discouraging. We just found out that we probably have another 15 month+ wait for an interview for my husband in Turkey after his I-130 is approved. We have already been waiting 14 months and still waiting on the I-130.  Luckily I am with him in Turkey now, but I can't work here and I miss my home, family, job, and just general life in the US. As a US citizen I deserve the right to live in my country with my husband. With recent events I have lost a lot of hope for our future in the US. I am really worried about additional delays. This process is already too long, but I know it can be so much worse. Praying for everyone out there going through this.  Hopefully there won't be too many issues ahead. Trying to stay hopeful but it's hard. Good Luck everyone!"
1gl09pe,lvqlrw5,u/daruzon,2024-11-06T16:45:17+00:00,94,"So, POTUS controls the executive branch, which can make policy changes.

A few examples of such changes include:

- USCIS staffing (such as furlough), number and thoroughness of background checks on cases (hugely affects backlogs and jacked those up during his first term)


- rigidity of certain requirements such as evidence that one won't be a financial burden when adjusting status


- backlogs can in many scenarios affect continued eligibility for benefit sought; one example I see a lot is spouses of US citizens in abusive situations who have to file I-360 after the I-130 and/or I-485 has been pending for a year, thus ending up in a hectic financial situation and in immigration limbo for 3-5y just because an AOS took over a year and things have gone to shit. In my own case, I just recently amended my joint I-751 for a battery waiver after it's been pending for 13 months. 10 years ago, these were approved within their statutory processing time which is 3-6mo


- there are many policy memos on certain visa renewals or conversions (such as the L1), on how to go about exercising discretion on cases that have a discretionary component, on what specific evidence to require in cases where the statute doesn't set that in stone, there are also policy memos such as the one from last year that allows conditional permanent residents to seek a new adjustment of status on other grounds if for whatever reason they're experiencing hardship and/or unreasonable delays in getting their conditions removed.


- the executive branch can also, by policy, limit possibilities for certain combos of concurrent filings


- Trump also promised to grow the denaturalization unit, which goes after naturalized citizens and looks for discrepancies in their immigration record. This unit already exists but it currently only focuses on people with a RICO (organized crime/terrorism) background and Trump promised to generalize it. The burden of proof remains on USCIS to prove to a federal court that someone meets the criteria to be stripped of their US citizenship, but still.


- During Trump's first term, ICE was instructed to detain any undocumented person they come across. The usual policy on the matter is focus ICE resources on those who commit crimes and those who get in the way of detaining them.

I'm sure there are other potential ramifications.

The bottom line is that while the legislative branch shapes laws which apply to everybody, the executive branch patches things up so it is very able to implement chiseled policies that target specific people.
How that power will be used this time around, we'll see, but POTUS is absolutely not powerless over immigration outcomes, regardless of how much support he gets from Congress."

If people actually listen to him speak, you'd know he wants people to come to the United States. He doesn't hate immigrants. He does hate criminals who cross the boarder illegally, and all the mad things like human trafficking, drug smuggling, etc.

Me and my wife sent our forms in to USCIS just before the election, we are still awaiting the receipt number in the mail.
My wife supported (Although couldn't vote) for Trump because of what illegal immigration does to those who do come to the United States the proper way. She faces stigmas and stereotypes because of how much of an issue illegal immigration is. She also hates how, by doing it the right way we have to go through so much stress, but if someone just wants to walk in illegally, they get everything handed to them.

Alawieh admitted to CBP officers that while in Lebanon - she attended a funeral for slain Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, who was responsible for the death of 400 Americans and thousands of Israelis and Lebanese nationals? The Lebanese terror group leader who supported the destruction of Israel oversaw the daily rocket attacks on that country which began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terror attacks. 

Alawieh was also caught by CBP with multiple photos of Nasrallah and other islamic militants in the 'delete folder' on her phone. Alawieh admitted to deleting the photos two days before her flight to the US so CBP would not see them as she didn't want them to effect her entry into the US.

Some nasty people will be off putting, but please remember we aren't all like them. I absolutely love going to store where there are people of other denominations, and sometimes there is a language barrier, but vibes always carry. Lol. We vibe, and if there is a language or communication error, we talk until we can pinpoint it and find a way to understand each other. I truly wish you the best here, and that you only deal with the most understanding of citizens.

It is quite common to get your green card through marriage without an interview. the real test will come when you try to remove conditions or natz. I am an immigration lawyer and cannot count how many clients came to me after failing their natz interview because they were so convinced after doing their green card on their own that they knew better than a lawyer.

We started in 2005, when we got married (I'm a US citizen) and he was on a student visa.  We paid $13,000 total because we ended up needing an immigration lawyer. It took him until 2007 to get his conditional green card, and then, in 2009, he got his permanent resident card.  I don't know if it's still the same, but he had to wait 5 years after that to get citizenship, which he got 2014.

Just one question: when you submitted your N-400 did you have your 10y GC or were you in the process of condition removal on your 2y GC?
The reason I’m asking, I’ll be eligible to apply in September for citizenship but am still waiting on my 10y GC. I know, USCIS says that I can apply and it’s ok. Just wondering about your personal experience if you don’t mind sharing, please?"
1l4akw1,mwy3tbb,u/rkkohli,2025-06-10T02:25:03+00:00,1,"Hello, if you don’t mind me asking what was your previous nationality? And did you get your 10 year green card before you applied for citizenship? My husband is on a 2 year conditional (he got it through our marriage) and the attorney said we have to apply for removal first and then once 3 years comes we can apply for citizenship. So I am trying to gage how long the timeline will be for us."

It all felt like a natural, normal conversation though. After that, he said I was approved but he still had to ask me all the yes/no questions on my application, so he did… which was a bit tedious! But that was all, very straight forward."

I found a link on Reddit to schedule the appointment online. So much better than waiting hours on the phone to get a live person. Mine was first a month out, but I kept checking “reschedule” and got one within a week.

It's basically an online version of the SS-5 form. At the end of the questionaire, you will be able to book an appointment.

1l4akw1,mw8y4dr,u/jsla7527,2025-06-06T02:25:26+00:00,3,I naturalized at the end of April and never got the card despite the checkbox. I don't really care since I have unrestricted already. But scheduling an appointment with SSA is basically impossible if you have a life. The wait on the phone is about 4 hours if it doesn't hang up on you. I believe there will be a lot of outdated information in SS records.

One thing is, if you came on a K1, make sure your spouse is there for your interview day. They brought us both in to the interview. And very basic questions they asked us. What type of visa entered the US on, how we met, what we do for work, nothing tricky at all. Then the civics questions, writing a sentence and reading a sentence. Honestly our interviewer talked more than we did, but he was great! Our interview was in Sacramento (California). I know it is high stakes (and can be stressful), but I think you shouldn’t worry too much about it. Just know what you put in your applications (all of them) and know your civics questions."

1gx8zc8,lyfio3a,u/Zrekyrts,2024-11-22T15:53:12+00:00,3,"Definitely a good idea, but be prepared to have to explain the process to staff, as it's not an oft-requested service. IME, a lot of the staff didn't know what it was.

Also, understand that in practice, there seems few real-life reasons to have a certified copy. After getting your passport, there is almost never a need to use the actual CON, and the entities that might want to see it almost always denand to see the original anyway. Certified copies of CON aren't even essential if looking to replace the CON.

Other options are to FOIA your entire immigration file or N400 file or order a copy from National Archives."

I have mine coming up in Broward and this might sound odd… But I was told by a friend to not bring my parents to the USCIS field office since they are not yet citizens (they do have a legal status/visa, just not residency yet). This is due to all the craziness that has been happening with people being detained randomly and taken into custody by ICE, even when having a legal status, etc. What are your thoughts on this, what was your experience like?

Any particular reason why you would think your case may be denied?

I understand the feeling of nervousness and anxiety building up.  Especially when I forgot to list my infractions on my N400 Form.   But I disclosed it to the officer during my interview, and I was honest about them.  The officer thanked me for being honest and disclosing the infractions.

Questions were only for my spouse/beneficiary. Mainly confirming that he wasn’t he to over throw the government and to confirm he didn’t have a criminal background which he didn’t. I was super worried about the medical examination but he had done that less than a year ago in Mexico with a Civil Surgeon. At the interview they didn’t accept his vaccines (done less than a month ago at a CVS). We were told that as soon as we got them done with a civil surgeon, send the results and the green card would be issued! Our translator informed me that so many lawyers she’s worked with screw up on the documents, over charge and when they’re at the actual interviews they’re mainly there for emotional support. So glad I was able to do everything on my own although at times it was nerve wrecking and stressful. Hope this helps someone."

So all in all I think we have a pretty simple process to even become citizens compared to other countries we have the bare minimum.

1jfx84y,mivwew2,u/Curious-Tangelo2,2025-03-20T23:32:33+00:00,2,"USCIS generally expects applicants to provide their own interpreters for interviews, they do provide sign language interpreters as a disability accommodation and may offer other language support in limited circumstances, such as rescheduling or allowing applicants to provide interpreters fluent in specified languages. 
Here’s a more detailed breakdown:
General Rule:
For most USCIS interviews, applicants are responsible for arranging and providing an interpreter if they need one due to language barriers. 
Exceptions:
Asylum Interviews: USCIS requires applicants to bring their own interpreter for asylum interviews, with the exception of sign language interpreters, which USCIS provides. 
Disability Accommodations: USCIS provides sign language interpreters as a disability accommodation for deaf or hard of hearing applicants. 
Limited Circumstances: In rare cases, if a USCIS interpreter is not available, they may reschedule the interview or allow the applicant to provide an interpreter. 
Overseas Interviews: In some overseas offices, USCIS employees or locally engaged staff may serve as interpreters due to local security protocols or the unavailability of competent interpreters. 
Interpreter Requirements:
The interpreter must be fluent in English and the language of the applicant. 
The interpreter must be at least 18 years old. 
The interpreter cannot be the applicant’s attorney, accredited representative, a witness testifying on their behalf, a representative or employee of the government of their country of nationality, or an individual with a pending asylum application who has not yet been interviewed. 
USCIS Language Access Plan:
USCIS has a language access plan that outlines their commitment to providing language assistance to customers, including creating videos in American Sign Language and interpreting website content into sign language. 
Naturalization Interviews:
Applicants may bring an interpreter to naturalization interviews, but they are expected to have knowledge of and be tested on their English language ability unless they have applied for a waiver based on age or disability. 
Adjustment of Status Interviews:
USCIS does not provide foreign language interpreters at adjustment of status interviews, so applicants may need to bring their own interpreter. 
Interpreters for Removal Proceedings:
Interpreters are provided at government expense to individuals whose command of the English language is inadequate to fully understand and participate in removal proceedings."
1jfx84y,miwr9zc,,2025-03-21T02:35:03+00:00,2,This is my first time hearing about this and I know this was definitely not a choice that USCIS would make on its own they would have had to have been told by someone up top to do it and it probably doesn't apply for Asylum interviews or credible fear interviews

It feels like the divide between us keeps growing, with both sides becoming more entrenched in their views. This cycle of resentment and hostility leaves little hope for change, and it’s easy to feel stuck.

But I believe we have a common enemy: the corporations—especially in healthcare and insurance—that profit off our hard-earned money. They’ve been so effective at keeping us divided that we’ve overlooked their unchecked greed for decades.

If we could set aside our differences, even temporarily, we could unite to take back these industries and hold them accountable. From there, we could start dismantling the systems that keep us divided and rebuild a country that works for all of us.

1mftr8d,n6jnm8j,u/Ok_Length_2677,2025-08-02T16:04:15+00:00,445,"We were told in our interview that it was a difficult case because we didn’t have a child! We are still married after 11 years. A child would have substantiated our marriage. It’s pretty hard for two gay guys to have children, but I told them “we are definitely trying … it just won’t take.” 

Our agent (a lady) thought that was hilarious."
1mftr8d,n6k0kvx,u/nun-o-ya,2025-08-02T17:13:43+00:00,52,"You should be ok. Seems like your attorney handled the situation well. It helps everyone when the supervisor is notified of an officers bad disposition. This is also why it's important to take an attorney to the interview. They know the limits of an officers power and when to check them. 

I have a friend who went to an interview at the LA office recently and the officer asked if he could unlock his phone so that he can review the social media profiles. His attorney told him not to give up the phone. My friend was approved a couple of days later."
1mftr8d,n6jqbfk,u/Infinite-Access1645,2025-08-02T16:18:42+00:00,62,"I’ve been seeing a lot of tough interviews happening these days. My husband and I had a difficult one as well, similar to how you described yours. Ours was in May, in Houston TX. The officer was very hostile and asked us why we didn’t file taxes together (I couldn’t file taxes as I didn’t have an SSN since they never approved my EAD). He even asked how my father in law became a citizen, as if that’s even relevant. He kept repeating the same questions. It was very uncomfortable. He also didn’t really look at our pictures and the first thing he said to us was “was this an arranged marriage, or what?” he handed us the same note at the end and he took my passport to photocopy it. 

Got my approval 2 days later."

And this is definitely one of the key reasons why having an attorney with you is important. Another reason is to have someone present during both discussions if they split you up. It sounds like she did an excellent job and said all of the right things. Nothing you mentioned was out of line from her. 

I see people here all the time saying attorneys aren’t necessary at interviews and a waste of money. Sure, it may end up going fine, but there’s just as much of a chance that it won’t.

You can be married and have every document and they will still question it. You can be separated with your ex for years, but if you are not divorced, they will say you are still married.  It might delay things a little bit but if your marriage is real, just keep on loving each other."
1mftr8d,n6mm7mk,u/theatottot,2025-08-03T02:12:45+00:00,5,"I’m sorry you had to go through that. It’s good that you had your attorney’s support. Our attorney back then decided to schedule her surgery on the day of our interview and she wasn’t cheap either. Felt like she was a scam. My husband and I went to the interview with my daughter from a previous marriage and I think it helped when she called him dad. The officer was nice. We were also interviewed separately with questions like what color was the curtain in our room? What did my husband have for breakfast? Did he shower? What side of the bed does he sleep on? She handed us a paper saying that we’d hear from them after that. 

Think positive. His attitude was probably the officer’s tactic to catch fraudulent marriage arrangements. He was trying to intimidate and “catch” you. Others probably fold. 

My citizenship interview was different. The officer was really strict. He asked for pictures like it was a green card interview. I told him they were on my phone. He said okay I can use my phone to show him. He was very direct and strict. But I did appreciate that he immediately told me that I passed unlike the first interview with my husband where the officer was very nice but left us with a cliffhanger answer.

We happened to relocate to Texas in the meantime and transferred our case due to change of address.

The interviewer starts off saying, “I know you are excited, but not everyone is happy in the US.”  She responded that she had no interest in moving to the US, but she wanted to be with me, and this was the only way. That was it. Approved. 

She flew from South Africa to London. We met there to have a pre-honeymoon. When we arrived in the US, they took her aside for processing. An airline employee came to me to say she had told immigration I was waiting, and they said that they would try hurry. 15 minutes later, we were together, and my wife had employment authorization. 

After we got married, we went in for an interview. We go in together. “How is everything going?” “Great.” “Just to let you know, this is conditional. In two years, you will need to apply to have that removed. A year later, you can apply for citizenship.” 

That was it. 28 years later, we I appear stuck with her. I can’t believe how painful the process has become."

The officer had crazy eyes bulging bout of his head but was pleasant enough. We brought bet prior with us, my wife couldn't remember my dob, and yet the officer seemed fixated in my employer. At the time my employer was a large  company and the officer just kept repeating how it was owned by another company (it's main rival). Both companies and their rivalry are well known. I thought maybe it was a trick question. He just kept repeating the same nonsense. He barely asked us about our marriage and living arrangements. Later he asked he we wanted his personal phone number in case we had an issue. This also seemed super weird. At the end of the interview I didn't know how to ask for the phone number and so asked him for a business card. This provoked him into becoming a crazy conspiracy theory person. He kept saying how we might plant his business card at a murder and try and implicate him. Surreal in the extreme. I don't know if these officers are trained to be weird or they just weird people for the job. It sucks for sure and I find it concerning to have seemingly unhinged individuals in charge of the fate and lives of so many."

I applied for it all on my own.

I was nervous for my green card interview and it was the easiest thing ever.

My wife and I went there without a lawyer.

I didn’t bring any documents with me.

We got called in and the only thing she asked was to see our marriage verification and just handed her some photos.

She asked how we met and that was it.

Always prepare like you’re going to war with these people. I don’t care what anyone says, but you can never be over prepared for these interviews. Imagine you presented 3 keys when he asked for 2. Imagine you had a print out from DMV showing that you already did your part with changing the address on your license. 

These officers talk tough, but at the end of the day, if you present the evidences, they will be defeated!

My sister went through it and if she made it,  I'm sure you can. 
She wasn't diagnosed with autism yet.  She had a meltdown and yelled at him in the Embassy after their marriage interview.

Here's their nightmare.

She met a guy and married him in India.  They told her at the time even though she wasn't ""Hindu"" she could just do a Hindu wedding because his family was and it was easier that way. 
Nope, India told her that for 2 people of 2 different religions to marry they would need to get a special marriage permit first.  Too late they were already married. 
So then they were like just convert to being Hindu, and do the ceremony again.  So she did. 
Then she was told Oh you need a letter from the American Embassy and then just do the ceremony again. 

Then they were told nope she hadn't gotten the correct form from the US Embassy to get married.  So she got it and got married again. 
Then they were told Oh he's not 21, you can't register your marriage yet. 
At this point, her visa was about to expire and she was having to fight to get it extended for 1 month until he turned 21. 
India extended it finally at the last minute after paying lots of fees to everyone.
He turned 21, and they got remarried again. She had 5 days left on her visa with the extension. 
They go to the Indian courthouse to get it registered and to make it official again. It was Thanksgiving Day in the US. The Indian government is now telling her she needs one more form of Identification besides her passport and wouldn't accept her American driver's license and to go to the American Embassy to get a letter from them. The American Embassy was closed until Monday morning. 
She called the Embassy emergency line and was told this was her fault for not coming to the Embassy sooner to get the correct paperwork. That this wasn't a real emergency. 
She was livid because she had been there twice already. 

Back to the Indian courthouse, they go to tell them that the American Embassy is closed.  She pulled out everything in her wallet on the floor to show them everything with her name on it.  They accepted her Costco card because it had her picture on it.  They must not have realized what Costco was. 
She was told that they needed to get married again there at the courthouse. 
Then they went to get her visa extended which was good for 3 months. 
The next Monday she was back at the Embassy and they told her, the marriage still wasn't valid.  And gave her more forms to fill out. 

They got married again. This time they said it looked like she had it done correctly. 

Then when they got to where they had the appointment for the marriage being real or not they put them into 2 different rooms and gave them a packet of 10 pages to fill out about themselves and each other.  She was also given an additional package of paperwork to fill out about why she converted to being Hindu, and she needed to include her favorite parts of the Hindu holy book. They did her interview part in Hindi, and she was told to read and write in Hindi.
She failed that miserably. Her husband is Punjabi Hindu and they speak Punjabi, not Hindi.

The guy who did the interview yelled at her for being a part of a scam marriage and for being a bad Christian for converting but not believing what she became a part of. 
They had barely passed the interview room when everything hit her and she started yelling at her husband about everything and for not teaching her anything about being Hindu. He was like my family don't believe this and we don't celebrate Hindu holidays, we celebrate Punjabi holidays. 

My sister made such a commotion with her meltdown that they had to go back in 6 weeks later for a new interview. The girl who did the new interview told her that they were only getting approved because her husband was still with her after that fight."
1mftr8d,n6uey0a,u/FknMods,2025-08-04T10:02:19+00:00,1,When my wife and I did this my wife was so worried about being prepared. I did nothing. I told her it'll show if we're honest or not. We got a good agent I believe... he asked us questions about living situation some photos. I just answered what I knew and was honest when I didn't. I told him it took me 2 years to remember my wife's name so I would absolutely not know her parents - she's thai. Her name is like richdgoejfirivj29tu2ughddkgjwhf in English so... the agent said he could tell we were legit cause I wasn't worried at all and she was.

1m4vg9q,n49j65i,u/Xenedra-jaan,2025-07-21T01:18:43+00:00,4,"My husband and I were wondering if it were possible to get second copies of his documents because we are so stressed about his GC physically having a date that is expired but because we are in the I751 phase, we have that letter that gives him a 4 year extension. I’m just worried some idiot will take it from him. In his country it’s actually pretty common for law enforcement to just tear up documents because there’s really no way to get replacements, so he’s been extra panicked about it."
1m4vg9q,n4eg9zo,u/MedvedTrader,2025-07-21T20:01:19+00:00,2,"... and as usual the story is starting to unravel. Every time some sensationalist ""oh look at the poor puppy"" story gets published, it is hiding all kinds of stuff.

1. ICE doesn't have the man's name in any of its databases.

2. Guatemalan authorities put out a statement denying that Luis Leon entered their country, saying no one of his name or age range matches any entries. Further, they confirmed no person of Chilean nationality has been deported to Guatemala either. 

3. You don't go to USCIS office to get your green card replaced. That has been true for decades now.

4. The Guardian reported today what The Morning Call had ""reported"" but added this ""A week later, however, [the family here in the US] discovered from a relative in Chile that Leon was alive after all – but now in a hospital in Guatemala, a country to which he has no connection"". Note: Mr. Leon or presumably someone from the Guatemala City hospital -- did not call his wife or the granddaughter in the US but a ""relative"" in Chile.

5. I also see that it seems that he is a visa overstay and not a Green Card holder. As in (from DHS statement): ""ICE's only record of this individual entering the U.S. is in 2015 from Chile under the visa waiver program.""

It is yet another hoax. Just like that ""mother of three in LA"" that faked her own kidnapping in order to get some money from the outraged liberals."
1m4vg9q,n4i2x06,,2025-07-22T10:39:58+00:00,2,My strategy is 1. Don’t lose it. And 2. Leave the US and surrender the green card before the card expiration date.
1m4vg9q,n4jxkm7,u/MedvedTrader,2025-07-22T16:42:07+00:00,2,".. and the plot thickens.

https://www.mcall.com/2025/07/21/luis-leon-allentown-grandfather-story-hoax-ice-says/

A Chilean journalist, Jose Del Pino of Canalo 13, said a doctor at the Guatemala City hospital where Nataly claimed to see her grandfather had no record of him.

Additionally, Del Pino said, a man by the same name and date of birth died in Santiago, Chile, in 2019. Chilean citizens are issued national identification numbers and none matches another person with that name and birthday, he said. Del Pino provided a copy of the death certificate to The Morning Call.

and even more fun:

Translation:

The family of the deported citizen also asked them to stop further investigation into the case, as they feel ""overwhelmed"" by the visibility it has generated and ""concerned"" that it could unintentionally cause complications for other members of their family. 

The latter, due to the fact that  other members of the family had irregular immigration status.
...
The journalist also noted that the journalists traveled to the Allentown neighborhood, where the man was said to be ""very dear"" to the family, but the neighbors did not know anyone by that name."

It is very hard to get the actual facts of a story anymore. The news is all biased to one side or the other and people these days just go around stating their thoughts as if they are ""facts"". It is a very strange world anymore. 
In my opinion which is not ""fact"" anyone who crossed the border illegally is a criminal. Their very first act in this country was illegal and yes they should be deported on that fact alone. There are ways to come to this country legally and that is the way people should do it. If you need asylum there are legal ways to that as well. Our country can not afford all of these illegals and our country will not survive this. I,  for one, am a proud American, proud of my country, and don't want it destroyed by people who snuck in here illegally, or by anyone else. All of these bleeding heart liberals are going to turn us into a socialist country which will destroy the America I grew up in. I am ashamed of this America we are today. We should all be.

The speed at which someone gets deported after being detained mostly depends on which country they need to be sent to, how many charter flights are running at the moment, the room on those charter flights, and available officers.

Providing his travel documents does help somewhat. Thanks."
1mmza5x,n8442tu,u/Nearby_Algae4713,2025-08-11T14:13:07+00:00,5,"6 weeks is considered a speedy process.  Just tell him to cooperate with the consulate interview, answering the questions.  They will ask him who he will live with and things like that.

Lawyers wont make it faster or anything.  How fast the process goes depends on when they have confirmed where the person will be going.  Save your hard earned money"

They are waiting till they can fill up the planes/busses or whichever transportation method they are going to use to take to deport people from your country.
Unfortunately, they don’t even know when this will happen and you just need to wait till it happens. I’m really sorry your family is going through that and I wish you luck."

I would respectfully suggest, and this is only if you guys can afford it, is to try and get a lawyer and fight for him if possible. May God be with you guys, guide and protect the both of you. God can help your brother, just like he has helped many others in similar situations. There’s hope, and he is called Jesus. If you’re a believer in Christ/God, I would recommend finding a church, consulting with a pastor, and have them pray for your situation. Never give up, because God will never give up on you guys! I have hope that this can all be turned around. Because he did it for a good friend of mine, and many others in similar situations, no matter what it looks like. God bless."

Even after a removal order, deportation can take weeks or months, depending on travel paperwork, flight availability, and ICE coordination with the destination country. Giving them his passport helps, but delays are common. Your best next step is to have an immigration attorney or nonprofit (like RAICES, ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, or local legal aid) follow up directly with ICE for updates and push for quicker processing."

feds have alot of power as you have experienced. ICE policy and procedure is varied, therefore its hard to pin down your brother's deport info. the burden is on the witness to f/u w/ice on their friends/family, etc..  immigration lawyer may help. there might be probono ones out there.

i don't know if there is a law /policy for ice requirement to update family members re: deportations/locations, etc.. maybe you can find out this policy/law on their webpage? 

i'm sure your deported brother will notify you once he's released somewhere outside of USA. hang in there."

They said hey we will share all we will show you things . The other set said no I will take what I want and they did . Why is always a different set of norms for one group with their actions leaving behind a wake of destruction and yielding themselves sovereignty . Just because I don’t govern or act exactly as you do doesn’t mean it’s wrong
1mmza5x,n9c3fw3,u/OpportunityUnhappy45,2025-08-18T12:10:20+00:00,1,It’s always the people or nations that think their way is the way . Just because they didn’t have laws that looked like “the sovereign “ laws doesn’t mean there were not laws .

You also mention he has no criminal record? Does that mean he came on a non-immigrant visa and has NOT violated any terms of the visa? 

One does not have to commit a crime to be deported, a violation of the visa (immigration) status is enough to be deportable."

1mmza5x,n8hyipz,u/jtvliveandraw,2025-08-13T17:03:58+00:00,2,"What’s absurd about it is it disregards ICE’s obvious goal, which is to deport people unlawfully present as quickly as possible within their budget. Rampant abuse would bring public scrutiny, official investigations, and court orders that would stifle their goal. And holding people any longer than necessary, just to make private jails and prisons money, would also be contrary to the goal and extremely easily to prove with obvious evidence of time incarcerated and the availability of flights, busses, and officers during that time. Do you have any such proof?

Also, how did the people in ICE custody die? People die in law enforcement custody because people die everywhere for any number of reasons. Just because someone died in ICE custody doesn’t mean ICE killed them or they were mistreated. Your sensationalistic point is unsupported by proof. But if you have such proof, present it."

1mmza5x,n81tpxw,u/mrdaemonfc,2025-08-11T03:10:27+00:00,38,"The whole point of deporting them to those ""third countries"" is that the local government can be bought off very cheaply to take them, they're not going to be free to go when they get there, there's not human rights in a place like Somalia or South Sudan, and the US government doesn't know and doesn't want to know what happens to them after they get there.

Even if they would let them go, they don't speak the language or have any ties there, so they couldn't do anything, so yes. They are getting on planes and leaving because it's better to go back somewhere you're from even without a plan, than to get sent to some of the worst countries in the world, on another continent."

1mmza5x,n8218us,u/WestCoast-DO,2025-08-11T04:05:53+00:00,-21,"LOL.. Your claim is laughably false

ICE controls the removals and time frame/scheduling.  The contractors/contract detention facilities are not involved in that process/decision.   Removals for OTMs involves more than just transporting them to the border.  They have to have a travel document/passport then either be scheduled for removal on a charter or commercial carrier depending on destination.  This could be anywhere from 1-4 weeks after the passport/travel document is obtained.

Additionally, If he reserved appeal then the order is not final until the appeal period expires which is approx 30 days after the order date."

4. Cases against individuals who committed **felonies** that were not disclosed during the naturalization process; 

5. Cases against individuals who committed **human trafficking, sex offenses, or violent crimes**; 

6. Cases against individuals who engaged in various forms of **financial fraud** against the United States (including Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan fraud and Medicaid/Medicare fraud);

You can commit any crimes you want AFTER naturalization and enjoy the industrial prison system just like any other Americans.

Melania worked as a model on a tourist Visa and Elon worked on a student visa that only granted him the 

Detailed accounting ledgers and contracts from Melania's modeling firm, Metropolitan International Management showed that she was paid for **10 modeling jobs worth $20,056 between September 10 and October 15, 1996.** This period falls *before* she officially obtained her H-1B work visa.

She entered the US in August 1996 on a B1/B2 visitor visa. A B1/B2 visa allows individuals to enter the U.S. for tourism or temporary business (like looking for work or attending meetings), but it **does not permit paid employment** within the U.S. for U.S. companies.

Elon Musk arrived in the U.S. in 1995 to pursue a Ph.D. in materials science at Stanford University on a student visa.  Musk dropped out of Stanford's graduate program very quickly, perhaps after only two days, to start his first company, Zip2, with his brother which would constitute **unauthorized employment** under U.S. immigration law.

Thus, they both **willfully misrepresented or concealed** periods of unauthorized work on their naturalization application (N-400) and this misrepresentation was **material** to their naturalization. 

IMO, if anyone gets de-naturalized for failing to disclose work prior to be legally to do so, they should challenge that the 14th amendment is being violated by enforcing the law on some and not others."

I know of only one such case - Hoda Muthana, where the government claimed that her father was a foreign diplomat when she was born. So she turns out to actually not be a citizen of the USA. 

But naturalized citizens can lose their citizenship a bit more easily and there have been a few hundred cases of this happening.

Reality is much simpler. They cant revoke your citizenship because of constitutional protections. But if they really want to revoke your citizenship then they wont need an excuse e.g. committing a crime. They will just revoke our citizenship anyway. Like Mandani is about to find out. Some might call it defeatist, but I as an immigrant have accepted that life is going to stay unfair for the rest of my life. Whether it be here or the “3rd world country” I came from.  I just have to find moments of joy and happiness where ever I am at the time. The Universe doesn’t owe me anything. But I definitely can hope someday someone emphatic and generous shows up.

This is the thing to pay most attention to in the memo released June 11th by the DOJ:

***The Civil Division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence. To promote the pursuit of all viable denaturalization cases available under 8 U.S.C. § 1451 and maintain the integrity of the naturalization system while simultaneously ensuring an appropriate allocation of resources, the Civil Division has established the following categories of priorities for denaturalization cases:***

***9. Cases referred by a United States Attorney’s Office or in connection with PENDING criminal charges, if those charges do not fit within one of the other priorities; and***

***10. Any other cases referred to the Civil Division that the Division determines to be sufficiently important to pursue.***

So regardless if you are charged or not they can use any pending charges to move forward with denaturalization. Not only that but as they are taking you to Civil Court, you are not entitled to legal representation. It also opens the door for even misdemeanor charges such as but not limited to; trespassing, disorderly conduct, minor drug possession, DUI and even driving 30mph over the speed limit to be grounds for denaturalization.

Denaturalization is for fraud committed during the application process. Hiding a criminal record to get citizenship is a classic example.

  
Committing a crime after you become a citizen is a criminal matter, not an immigration one. You face the justice system like any other American. They don't take away your citizenship for that. The real risk is if you concealed something on your application in the first place."

Adding (as this is my country of origin)...Portugal's recent elections saw the rise of the Chega party (look it up - many parallels to the current Republican party) - the first time in the country's history where a third party upended its historical two-party majority gov't. Chega is now in 2nd place knocking the socialist party to 3rd. They won primarily due to opposition to open borders/illegal immigration. Sound familiar?"

1m0ldrq,n3c2387,u/Nassas02,2025-07-15T21:15:19+00:00,1,Yes it was both approved after interview
1m0ldrq,n3c2cj1,u/Nassas02,2025-07-15T21:16:35+00:00,1,"No, I didn’t get the combo card :( i never even received anything back about the travel authorization!"
1m0ldrq,n3c2g4t,u/Nassas02,2025-07-15T21:17:05+00:00,1,Everything will work out!!!! Wishing you the best
1m0ldrq,n3c2n6g,u/Nassas02,2025-07-15T21:18:02+00:00,1,I think the two year green card is the “conditional green card” since after that you have to apply for the 10 year and prove you are still married to make sure you didn’t just fake a marriage to get an green card
1m0ldrq,n3c2rfw,u/Nassas02,2025-07-15T21:18:37+00:00,1,Was just very lucky! Wishing you the best and you will get it soon 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

1m0ldrq,n4clk24,u/Nassas02,2025-07-21T14:48:34+00:00,2,Mine was like 30 months! But those times are always wrong

I was supposed to stay here for vacation and decided to do my last semester of university online, that’s when applied for an extension. After that we decided that we should get married! Don’t worry your time will come as well, wishing you luck"
1m0ldrq,n4gg79e,u/Environmental_Ant526,2025-07-22T02:30:36+00:00,1,You applied and were approved in 5mths?

I just got interviewed for asylum, 10 years after applying. While waiting, my daughters have become registered ICU nurses, I started as a CNA , worked crazy hours to support my kids through nursing school, bought my house 4 years after we arrived America, currently in school to obtain my second bachelor degree and teaching certificate for elementary school. We have put in the hard work and we have been blessed beyond our wildest dreams . America is indeed the land of opportunities. We are currently waiting for a decision on our asylum application. Please, guys say a prayer for us. I am beyond scared right now especially with all that is going on. Again, congratulations. I am sorry, I just needed to get somethings off my very heavy chest.

For me, the oath ceremony was not the same day as the interview… Seems like some FOs do it on the same day, but I think most likely they’ll schedule a separate day for your oath ceremony! You’ll be fine! Just study the questions from the civics test, and stay calm!"

I was fully expecting to be told to wait until I get a letter in the mail to let me know when to come back for the ceremony, but then she said it’ll be done today and she continued her sentence. I honestly have no idea what she said after though because I honed in on her mentioning that the oath ceremony could be done today. When she finished talking, I literally asked her “the ceremony can be done today?” 😆"

I only recently started crying because I just finished telling a couple of my closest friends this news. They had no idea that I was not a citizen this whole time. I broke down when I was telling them of my parents’ struggles and my own struggles, and I couldn’t stop the flow of tears as I was thinking back on everything that’s happened and finally telling them. All the hurdles and money and waiting and setbacks and keeping so much to myself because I don’t like to burden anyone else with my problems. What could they do anyway? They couldn’t fix anything. So why bother them with my problems? I now know, at the very least, it would’ve helped me mentally to talk about what was happening in my life instead of shutting them out of a huge part of my life."

Happy for your interview, good luck! "
1iufbp1,me1dkfw,u/ilmdf18,2025-02-21T19:06:43+00:00,2,"The officer who interviewed me was very professional and polite. She smiled only at the end when she said she’s recommending my approval and smiled again as she was directing me back to the lobby. I’ve read about other cases who get officers who are more conversational and outgoing. I can also be socially awkward but I went in with the mentality of being 1000000% professional because I mean… it’s the freakin USCIS. I wasn’t about to start cracking jokes and cursing and making meme references. I only answered with short direct answers and only once did I elaborate on an answer. It was when she asked about the citations question on the N400. I mentioned the red light camera ticket in 2020 and speeding ticket in 2014. If your officer mentions something about the question you’re referring to, then I’d probably clarify the dates just to be super transparent and apologize for putting the incorrect date. If the officer doesn’t ask about it and you pass everything else and you can kinda tell that you’re going to be approved… I personally would probably not bring it up myself unless it’s really bothering me. Idk. I’m not a lawyer and it’s difficult to say what I would do in your exact scenario because it’s not something that happened to me. 

Keep studying those civic questions in whichever format works best, go over your N400 answers, and use whichever studying resources work best for you and your case. I’m sure you’ll do well 🙂"

I got back from Mexico in Feb and there was no problem but I really want to be prepared now. 
Anyone got tips?
This is my list for now-
1. Delete Reddit app from phone  and account  a month before coming back to US.
2. Delete all emails where even centrist newspapers have sent emails with negative views of the current administration (I haven’t even read 90 percent of these) and unsubscribe to them.
3. Look at YouTube and Facebook and delete my history- almost all of it is non- political but I might have ‘liked’ some comments or posts.

Any others?

Editing to add other things I thought of in case anyone uses this checklist

4. Tik tok and instagram
5. Podcasts
6. WhatsApp and Messages for any forwards"

Whether this is true or not, as long as you're nowhere near this line of thinking, you really have no reason to worry.

The other reason you might have to worry is if you stayed outside the U.S. for more than 180 days and did not settle things beforehand - in which case the trouble was entirely avoidable by either not doing it, or by obtaining a re-entry permit before traveling.

If you have any sources of PRs being detained/deported other than these two, please share - I promise I'm open minded, I am just not aware of any others. Happy to learn about it."

For example, a retired Cornell law professor states, “one of the more obscure grounds that has existed for many years allows the secretary of State to put someone into deportation proceedings if the Secretary determines that that person's presence has serious adverse foreign policy consequences. This administration seems more willing to use these old deportation grounds that have been around since the Red Scare of 1950s as a way to go after people who do speak out”

Border agents are less concerned with someone with Global Entry as they've already been screened. If you enter by air, you can use the GE app to pre-declare and agents won't even ask you any questions. 

If there's something suspicious in your background that could cause issues at the border, you'll probably have your application rejected. If you do something that warrants further suspicions while you have GE (like agricultural customs violation), your GE will be revoked. 

You are absolutely correct that you can still be pulled into secondary even with GE if an agent deems them concerning.  It's not a foolproof thing but it should make it easier to cross the border."

They called delta HQ but didn’t get a response and said I can’t fly, and to prepare to be sent to Pakistan - the passport I was using to fly. One delta rep was very kind and kept trying to call HQ and gave me updates every 30 min or so - I think she was the shift in charge or something, and eventually they got through after a few hours and they gave the go ahead to let me board but to let me I know I would be detained when I land. Ended up going into secondary screening in Detroit as I landed but they were all friendly there.

Similar things happened enough times that I filed for a Redress Number which helped for a few years but last year I once again got pulled into secondary despite being a USC now.

I did AOS while i was still in the country on my F1 visa. 

I did everything by myself (no lawyer) from start to finish. I have a really straight forward case with plenty of good bona fide evidence. Did a lot of googling and YouTube. I can’t give a good recommendation as I don’t know your specific case, but if it’s straight forward it is possible to do it by yourself! I’m glad i did as i saved money and feel like i had full control of the process.

No question is invasive, happy to help!"
1o4t8c4,nj4svu0,u/AutomaticStress7516,2025-10-12T17:20:48+00:00,7,"Thank you!

I had a combo interview of I751 and N400 at Dallas FO. Was really nervous but turned out super quick and chill. 

I751 — only 2 real questions: “anything new in your marriage” and “you guys have property together right?” I think the evidence submitted was good enough so it was more so a yap session rather than an interview. I offered an updated evidence package and the officer said he’s got enough and don’t need to see more.

N400: did the writing and spoken test then asked 5 easy questions. 

Overall a very positive experience! Was a lot better than i expected."

However, since living in the US and surrounded my amazing people who might have parents or relatives that are undocumented and see how they do try but unable to obtain legal status, I changed my perspective. 

Most of them are kind and good people who simply wanted a better life for their children. They work hard, pay taxes and do no harm to those around them. Once they become undocumented, it’s almost impossible to fix it unless their children join the military. 

I mind my business. I’m happy that I’m able to achieve this. But that doesn’t make me question those who couldn’t."

According to some day calculator I used, I should be eligible to file for N400 sometimes in 11/2025 but I did leave the country for about 3 weeks while was on the 2 year conditional GC so I wasn’t sure the exact day.

Here is my timeline:
      03/2022: Filed I485 and I130
      02/2023: GC approved without interview 
      01/2025: Filed I-751"

I don’t understand the all out hatred towards immigrants, but on the other hand I do understand that we can’t have massive uncontrolled illegal immigration so it’s a hard line to determine where ‘we’ put that number at, so to speak."
1o4t8c4,njbi5e6,u/AutomaticStress7516,2025-10-13T18:50:00+00:00,2,Hi! The calculator is correct. You should be able to file n400 90 days before your 3 year anniversary of GC (which is around November based on your case). You being gone for only 2 weeks should be fine. I was also outside the country for a month at a time multiple times during my conditional GC.
1o4t8c4,nj6kody,u/AutomaticStress7516,2025-10-12T22:56:23+00:00,2,I filed 7/30/2024 and interviewed on 8/29/2025. Dallas FO.
1o4t8c4,njbo6xw,u/AutomaticStress7516,2025-10-13T19:19:48+00:00,1,It really depends on the case. If yours is only n400 it should only take a few months. Mine was pending i751 and n400 which is why it takes much longer.
1o4t8c4,nj8kjk5,u/blastoise1988,2025-10-13T07:47:31+00:00,2,"If you don't mind sharing, how many weeks are between you receive the letter with the notice of interview scheduled and the date of the interview?"

1o4t8c4,njbss5g,u/AutomaticStress7516,2025-10-13T19:42:43+00:00,1,Ugh yea so it will be a bit long. Are you also at Dallas FO? From someone I know who’s an immigration lawyer she explained that officers need to be more qualified and experienced to handle combo cases i751 and n400 which is why it takes longer than regular n400. Also there’s a lot of staffing changes with the new administration and the Dallas FO is a bit short staffed when it comes to those more qualified officers. Hopefully it doesn’t take that long for you!

If we don’t have it and he is a stickler I wonder if they will reject him on the spot ( that is our fear) getting the original with a notary from Denmark is 285 Euros and though we can pay it, I would love to save that much money and time for something they may not even care to see the “ original with an inked stamp etc”

And keep in mind that there are people out there who have certain dreams, and only have so much time to make them happen before they age out. My husband for example, wanted to become an Air Traffic Controller, which is limited to a certain age range and you have to be a citizen for that. In my case I was a _conditional_ green card holder and I still couldn’t apply for certain jobs because they were for green card holders who needed to have at least 1 or two years in their green card before expiration… There are jobs out there, including positions in the Army and the Air Force that specify that. My removal of conditions application had been pending for 16 months without interview after the green card had expired, and some people have to wait for over two years after filing. In my case, the fastest way for me to get out of that limbo situation was to become a citizen."

A couple mins past 10, the officer called me and we walked down a long hallway to his office. He had me swear an oath, and go through my whole naturalization application, verifying my information

Then we went over my travel history. I was never out of the country for more than 6 months at a time, but I had spent around a year outside the US in the last 5 years. Plus I had been to over 10 countries, and was traveling frequently, So naturally, he asked me about that. After  that, we went through the civics test

My questions were

1)What does the Constitution do?

2)What are two rights in the Declaration of Independence?

3)Who makes federal laws?

4)What are two Cabinet-level positions?

5)Under our Constitution, some powers belong to the 
federal government. What is one power of the federal government?

6)What are the two major political parties in the United States?

Then we did the written test and that was it. I chatted with the officer about my vacations and he asked for travel recommendations lol. It was a very chill and relaxed experience."

When I tried to tell them that isn’t the norm and these laws have always been in place, they don’t believe me and truly believe they will get locked up and deported because they aren’t American. They quote me the German student who got detained and deported by ICE when coming over from Mexico. They fail to acknowledge that she literally told the CBP officer she was coming to work at her friends tattoo shop in LA on her ESTA (which is illegal and has ALWAYS been against the law in America).

Then they take you to secondary inspection and you wait there for an hour until they let you go. Used to happen to me with the green card but not anymore with an American passport

I said Trump and his supporters have issues but don’t call him a fascist or nazi and demean the horrific acts that happened in WW2.

Yes, this is bad but is it holocaust bad? OBVIOUSLY NOT YOU NUMPTY. Stop claiming all these things make Trump the same as Hitler. They DO NOT and nothing ever will be as horrific as that dark part of history. 

Every single one of you who keep calling these thing fascist or nazi are equally as bad Trump and you are part of the problem."

Please don’t demean or belittle the suffering of people that went through those horrific events of WW2 under Hitler. 

Trump and his supporters may have issues, but do not call them fascists because they are not. To call them that and put them on the same level as the German Nazis and Hitler is pure insanity. 

Good luck in life if you believe what you do. You’re crazy dude."

Keep that USCIS account in case you later want to immigrate your parents or siblings. In fact, even if you don't think you want to now, submit the petitions anyway because they take years to get approved and situations changes. Take this from my personal experience."

The naturalization cert says don’t make copies without lawful authority.  I was advise by USCIS to take a backup copy for myself and that’s it.  I wouldn’t be giving copies to anyone else.  Why does an employer want it anyway?  It’s none of their business.  If they need proof of citizenship, show them your passport."

I had my naturalization ceremony on June 10th, 2025 and my husband couldn’t wait to apply for my daughter’s passport and mine and he sent the naturalization certificate without a copy. 

Should I need a new one- I don’t think so but just in case I’ll need one before I get it back- where do I apply for? 

Also - a question for whoever has applied for a new SS number at their naturalization application- do you know if it’s ok to apply for the passport with the SSN you have in case you’ve applied for a new one together with the naturalization application but the new one hasn’t arrived yet?

1mjcw5p,n7bq9mk,u/xxxamazexxx,2025-08-06T23:40:57+00:00,-5,"Filing I-130/485 has never granted legal status, just an 'authorized period of stay', which generally protects you from removal. A judge can still order you removed if there are aggravating factors, but unless they have strong reasons to they won't.

The 'new' policy doesn't change that, because it isn't actually new. USCIS has always been able to issue you a NTA whenever they want. They just put that into writing.

And my guess is that they will be doing so at their discretion in 'sketchy' cases like consular processing, asylum seekers, EWI, criminal records, etc. It would be another waste of time to start removal proceedings against a simple visa overstayer who might even get their green card before they have to appear before a judge, who would likely clear them anyway."

Right now, the international press reports that the US is unfriendly to foreigners and that there may be problems at the point of entry no matter how slight the risk. The tariff policy re-enforces this feeling of unfriendliness. As a result tourists and visitors choose alternative destinations. Likewise, the once loud American abroad that was somewhat humorous now appears to be a bully. The inhumane treatment of deportees in poor conditions is a bad look that puts people off even further. High tariffs for countries like Switzerland results in less tourists to the US out of a feeling of retaliation and a reluctance to buy American goods.

The US being hostile to its neighbors might be popular to a certain part of the American electorate, but for many tourists and purchasers of US goods it just makes the US look somewhat of a bully and not somewhere you would even want to go, let alone buy their goods and services. To Trump and MAGA it might be regarded as the art of the deal, but in Trump’s world there are only winners and losers. When others get to be the losers, there is a knock on effect of not wanting to deal with him, and by association the US in the future. You can win a battle but lose a war when you have no effective diplomacy.

All my relatives who come to the US to go skiing and visit the national parks have cancelled and chosen to go to destinations perceived as more friendly. The US was always a popular destination amongst people I personally know, they loved their visits to the US. Now, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various EU countries are perceived as the new US.

Living in a state where outdoor tourism is the lifeblood, bookings and future visitor levels are way down, especially as even domestic tourists are staying home because of uncertain economics.

So every time DJT gets up and says something stupid or silly, the consequences “of, oh that’s just Trump being Trump” are far deeper than one thinks. To potential visitors and foreign purchasing trends, they are not a joke. America is much the poorer for these random threats and questionable actions. They may work in private business amongst wealthy business entities, but at a human level he is a bad face for the country once loved for its openness and friendliness."

https://wttc.org/news/us-economy-set-to-lose-12-5bn-in-international-traveler-spend-this-year

> In 2024, nearly 90% of all tourism spending came from domestic travel, with Americans holidaying at home in record numbers.

International tourism is not dropping to 0 either of course. This industry association projects that of the $2600B tourism revenue for the US in 2024, there'll be a $12.5B drop in international tourism revenue in 2025. That's a 0.48% drop in overall tourism revenue for the US.

By the way, the US tops the global chart for international tourism revenue at ~$200B in 2024. The next highest is [Spain at ~$100B](https://www.unwto.org/tourism-data/global-and-regional-tourism-performance). ~$2400B of US tourism spend is domestic. 

Many people don't understand how incredibly wealthy America is, even if that wealth is very unevenly distributed. [Majority of this spend is driven by the top 10%](https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/us-economy-strength-rich-spending-2c34a571), and with the US stock market [hitting all-time highs in July](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/27/investing/stock-market-record-dow-sandp), it bodes well for the top 10% and their continued tourism spend in 2025."

There are many people who want to visit and have no intent on overstaying, and are more than willing to risk/guarantee money on it. My wife’s family has been unable to visit us since she got a green card as immigration thinks they are trying to move here. Not the case at all, they are wealthy and happy in their home country. They just want to visit us! 

I’ve even written a letter offering to put up $25-$50k that they won’t overstay. There is no system in place though currently for such, but it sure as heck will improve the end result. Poor families trying to move to US won’t be able to get visa. True tourists who have the money to benefit the economy, will be able to visit now with easier approval, with a strong money guarantee.

If you also got this email and think there's even the slightest chance it could affect you, please do contact someone that might be able to clear your doubts, ESPECIALLY if you came in under CBP One or are CHVN.

Try calling USCIS. Call them, do not use their online chat service, as the only thing they did after making me wait ~10 minutes was tell me to call ICE and then close the chat immediately.

If you have a lawyer working on your case, ask them if you haven't already. If you don't, try to contact one even if it is just for that simple question of whether it applies to you or not.

DHS or ICE might be able to give you a response, but I didn't try talking to them so I can't be sure. I've seen people contacting their congressperson too.

Sorry for ditching the post, I've been busy all day, but I finally have a breather to wish you all good luck. Since I got my questions answered, I won't answer any more about my personal experience, at least not publicly.

> An applicant fails the speaking test when he or she does not understand sufficient English to be placed under oath or to answer the eligibility questions on his or her naturalization application. The officer must still administer all other parts of the naturalization test, including the portions on reading, writing, and civics.

Additionally, practice English with him. Encourage your family to do the same. Get him in the habit of speaking English as much as possible (especially if there are community events/orgs he can get involved with). Based on where you said your uncle drove from, I’m guessing he’ll be celebrating a really important festival that involves sacrificing goats in the next couple of weeks.

I have failed applicants many times that don’t understand English when we start talking about there questions they answered on there application. For example, “ have you ever said you are a U.S. citizen” . Many have said yes , so I would re word that question three times in an effort for them to correct themselves because if that was true , they would be bared from citizenship. The safest bet was to fail them and tell them to go study or practice with family for their 2nd chance interview. 

Please speak to him in English and ask him questions to see if he is understanding . Officers can be sticklers about this because there are many schools that teaching applicants how to fraud this testing method. Hope that helps"

Super tangential, but I think this system is actually easier/better for immigrants to succeed in than the current US system, even though nominally the language requirement in the US seems less stringent.

One reason is that the Common Framework has very clear requirements and criteria for each level and is much less reliant on the adjudicator's discretion. Another is that usually language testing is done at a language learning center and immigration authorities just review the certificate you get for passing the test, so you're both being evaluated by professionals who specialize in language learning and whose primary role isn't determining your eligibility for an immigration benefit, and it's also a lot less stressful when you're not doing it in front of an immigration officer on top of a bunch of other stressful things."

The best way to learn a language is if you can speak in its rhythm and doing that kind of accent when you don’t feel like a native speaker makes you think you are being offensive but you are just talking closer to a native. 

It took me awhile to realize in Spain that when trying to speak clearly I was enunciating in a way that would make my speech clearer to Americans and that made it harder to understand for Spaniards. The more I accentuated my j’s and lisped my c’s and spoke with the rhythm of speedy Gonzales the more understandable I was. I notice the same thing happens with my Slavic wife when trying to speak clearly to Americans she doesn’t know. It even happens with Scottish people with thick accents where they are more understandable talking to their friends than when trying to speak clearly to Americans."

The rejected person would just blame themselves no matter how unfair/biased the officer might've been and wouldn't question them. You would be quite naive if you thought they're all kind and tolerant people. The lack of oversight can easily give rise to people who inpudently defy the law because they know nobody can obstruct them and even if it happens, they'll face no consequences. 

And right now, there have been a lot of instances where immigration officials(especially ICE) took extreme measures against people, completely unprovoked. Hell, there is a man in Salvador right now who was mistakenly deported and the administration [refused](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-el-salvadors-bukele-says-he-will-not-release-man-mistakenly-deported-issue-preposterous) to cooperate after Department of Justice ordered his return to the US. There's a lot of unfairness out there, with no one to defend the innocent."

Historically, Natz interviews were rubber stamped and any officer that wasn’t on board was counseled (Some even ordered to stop failing applicants for lack of English).  Many years ago.. I personally would deal with recently Natz’d citizens as they filed N600 applications and due to their complete lack of English their minor child would have to translate during the encounter.  When this was brought up about how come significant number of recently Natz’d citizens (that didn’t qualify for a waiver) couldn’t even speak/understand basic English the response from Management was that they are US Citizens now and they don’t have to speak English.  Little to no emphasis placed on having the applicant be able to actually be somewhat proficient in English.  Hopefully, that has changed."

You mention your father had an interpreter. Did he get an exemption from having to learn English due to his age AND try to get an exemption from taking this oral test via an interpreter based on the argument  ""Even with an interpreter I have a medical condition that prevents me from understanding questions""?

That sort of thing might piss a USCIS officer right off."

We’re there to make sure that USCIS officers acts appropriately and to keep them in line and if they pull stuff like this, to request a supervisor. I’m shocked the officer let a relative in for any reason. Citizenship isn’t based on a family petition, and family members aren’t allowed to interpret. Also, illiteracy isn’t typically a medical condition that would have qualified for the language exception. Still, having  an attorney would have helped him prepare better, would have made the process go smoother, and probably would have resulted in an approval rather than a denial. I don’t know what attorneys in your area charge, but I charge $1500 for the entire process including form preparation, collection of documents, interview preparation session, and appearance at the interview. I also attend the oath ceremony with my clients to make sure nothing goes awry there. There have been reports of people who got approved at the interview and then had that approval reversed at the oath ceremony because the person at the check-in desk didn’t think they spoke fluent enough English. This happened the first time Trump was in office and I expect it will happen this time too. Don’t risk it. Find an attorney to go to the interview with him."

As an example, I became good friends with an English couple years ago. The husband was in the US on a work visa, employed by one of the big four accounting firms. He and his wife had twin girls while still in the US for no other reason than we were at that age and it was that time in their marriage. They’ve since moved back to England, but their daughters are now working age. They are required to file US tax returns on any income, and may have to pay taxes if the difference between the UK and US are different.

I have diagnosed ADHD I am definitely not good at putting timelines together of my past. My husband grew up in a 3rd world country with no parents around no celebrating birthdays or anniversaries. I had to remind him our wedding anniversary was coming up and he had no clue that was a thing lmao god bless him. He's such a good dude though and it was love at first sight for both of us. I can describe in detail the day I met him and how I felt. We have a beautiful daughter together and plenty of photos together. I hope we'll be ok because I'm very worried about how he'll do and if he'll be able to pull it off without looking suspicious or like he's not into this marriage because he doesn't remember shit when it comes to dates and stuff.

You can have the most bona fide marriage on Earth and something as simple as nerves could fuck it up. An attorney can help you navigate that and just having a legal representative sitting quietly in the back knowing they're paying attention, taking notes, and making sure the USCIS officer stays in their lane is a HUGE help. 

To answer your questions. Officers are usually pretty good at differentiating nerves from fraud. But this could go either way. You'll just have to wait to see which direction it goes. If you really think it was THAT bad, you could start consulting with a few attorneys now to get their opinion, especially because some might be familiar with the officer who conducted the interview and could offer some clarity as to their thought process. And if you do get a NOID or are called for a second interview, for the love of everything that is holy HIRE AN ATTORNEY!"

How would I know where he was born, I wasnt there!"" 
It's funny now, but in the moment he wanted to strangle me 😂.
It's a stressful situation, give your husband some slack 😜.

I was totally waiting for the ""what color is your husband's toothbrush"" question, like in that Greencard movie 😜.

We waited probably around 10 minutes to be called in. They called me in first. We went over the yes/ no questions. Then we briefly discussed my 751, which was approved a few days prior. The funny thing is that the officer asked me “how long are 751s taking? Because my wife has a pending one” I literally blurted out “idk! You work at USCIS, not me!” And I immediately thought “damn, you should be more polite!”Once they were done with the N400 test, officer called in my husband, who had the nerve of asking “can I run to the restroom real quick?” Of course the answer was no. Thank god the officer was extremely kind and friendly. I’m now a USC. 
You’re going to be fine. Your husband did not do it on purpose. Some people (like me and my husband and obviously yours) don’t do well under pressure lol"

1m1f9lw,n3hopxj,u/CardiologistCalm7847,2025-07-16T18:40:45+00:00,1,They probably only said that so he can get nervous and if it was fake for him to confess. If your I-130 got approved then he saw your marriage as sufficient for him. I dought there is going to be a second interview because the I-130 is the one that shows if your marriage is legit or fake. Your I-485 should get approved any time soon.

I enjoyed my scheduled oath ceremony (Philly field office, August 2024) very much. It was wonderfully  moving and dignified.

But I was the only guy to wear a tie.  😆 Most women dressed nice. (One family of 6 or 7 wore matching indigenous clothes, something the officer leading the ceremony praised effusively.

My wife is a green card holder, she is eligible to apply for U.S citizenship in 6 months. Her (non-US) passport is expiring in 2 months, should I try to renew her passport now or can I apply N-400 form with an expired passport to get U.S passport/naturalization. I am a US citizen and my wife also would like to be one.



We don't want to go through the hassle of applying for her current passport and renew it if expired passport is ok.



Do you know anything about this? If someone know, please feel free to chime in. Thank you"

However you can’t assume you will have a Same Day Ceremony - usually you have to wait to be scheduled. 

If you have to wait to be scheduled you’d travel on your normal passport that you have now & return on your GC as normal. Assuming it’s a short trip you’d do your Oath Ceremony after you’ve returned.

1n1sdhb,nb1kgdi,u/xregnierx,2025-08-27T23:52:59+00:00,5,"Derived citizenship, my father had actually served in the military for 10+ years before I was born but because of a miscommunication (and operation fiery vigil) my admittance to the US was murky and my N-600 was denied all the way back in 1994.  Each appeal kept getting met with a brick wall.

The fact I was able to appeal a 30+ year old application was a miracle in and of itself."
1n1sdhb,nb6sisq,u/MollyAyana,2025-08-28T19:32:29+00:00,1,What is your particular situation if you don’t mind me asking?
1n1sdhb,nb71nr0,u/xregnierx,2025-08-28T20:17:11+00:00,3,"I obtained citizenship when I was born.

Father personally filed my foreign birth promptly, so parentage was legitimated and a divorce agreement cemented financial support.  INA301/309 were fulfilled. 

But never actually received a consular report of birth abroad nor was an N-600 completed and approved(issues with my dad proving his time on Us soil, conditions that should have been fulfilled by his then current military service but USCIS ignored his records for some reason)

because of an issue with my entrance to the United States(a military operation to transport military service members and their loved ones directly to US soil), I was marked incorrectly at the SSA.  I wasn’t aware of ANY of these issues until after I turned 18.  Because of my age, I was no longer afforded most of the ‘easy’ things that can be done or sponsored for a minor person and needed to do these things myself.  The entire process is riddled with catch 22s from the national level all the way to the county level.  SSN card needs state ID, DMV needs your SSN.  

There’s a chance I could have filed for passport with all my info but I know there is an SSN verification check so I assumed with the problems I had run into with that, that a passport application might be denied.

Anyways, I gathered a mountain of evidence to the contrary of why my original N600 was denied back in 94 and successfully reopened the case, further proved my claim and was approved."

It only helps business owners who want Americans wages kept low do to desperate workers. Schools spend a lot of money or ESL teachers...because now days immigrants don't even try to learn english..plus when did running from problems ever help anyone...these people need to go home..I understand that it can seem cruel and many people are like why can't they come here! I know I'm not a monster..but I am a realist..


It's like the Titanic..your on a life boat and you hear the cries of dying people, however,  if you go back to help, people will most likely be panicked, and turn the boat over thus killing everyone....


Or put your oxygen mask on before your child's so that you don't pass out and you both die.


These are extremely simplistic examples  between a realist and an idealogical thinker..its easy to say save everyone, no guilt, no moral questions for yourself...but you just sacrificed your kids, grandkids.


Realistic/pragmatic are always the ones that do the good things because they are not afraid to make the hard decisions. 
FDR- SS and people hated him for starting it...HSTruman and the bombs but saved 2 million American and Japanese army, children and women.


If all these people left today? Would they all die ? No, they would be forced to deal with their own countries problems, wow how unfair!! 


American companies,  oh shit walmart, Amazon, fed ex, all fighting for the same workers...golly gee Wizz what are we going to do? Oh shit, we are going to have to compete..but that will give real American families some power...they could buy homes, one could stay home,...but my 99% profit margin will go down to 50% !!!!!!
Well, I'm going to get my workers and protect my family, Walmart says!!
Okay starting wage and full benefits 27 $ an hour...
Amazon and others go oh no and on and on it goes...bidding for us Americans. 


Think about it, get tough and start sticking up for yourself..for those whose ethics can't live with that it's okay, and I understand...you can always try and become a citizen there and don't forget your kids! "

Do not attempt to classify your self as one before hand or get into any trouble. You’ll receive a letter in which you’ll have to read and fill out. Those questions are referring to “AFTER” your interview. And they even want evidence of TRAFFIC VIALATIONS where as when applying for n400. They do not. So relax !
1ljqak7,mzlxqpz,u/Stick830,2025-06-25T00:03:43+00:00,3,Congrats. I became a citizen on April 10th after 30 years 🙏🙏🙏🙏

I actually submitted both my I-130 and I-485 at the same time, just to see what would happen. I ended up getting an RFE (Request for Evidence) asking for my I-94—so I applied for it then and there.

Sometimes it takes a few different routes, but don’t give up. It’s possible."

That statement is VERY politically charged. Overstaying your visa not a criminal charge and you can ask any lawyer cuz I’ve heard 2 lawyers say that.

1ivzdfk,medbbn7,u/Oliverrder,2025-02-23T17:12:43+00:00,1,"My OP: August 6

I got approved for my I-765 just one day after my biometrics appointment and received my EAD card within a week!

However, my I-485 and I-130 are still pending. 🥲 My I-485 progress shows that they skipped the interview step and moved straight to the final decision stage, but it’s been stuck there for about 3 months now.

I’ve noticed that many people with September OPs have been getting approved recently. Is the system just random? 😮‍💨

Anyway, congratulations to you! Hoping my turn comes soon! 🎉"

You’re blessed because when I was enlisting in the military years ago; the Air Force never allowed 2 year conditional PR join their branch (Gotta have a 10 year GC), so I went down the rough Army part lol. Glad to see they now do though 🎉

Thank you for your service 🫡"

I enjoy that too but would like to experience the military probably the navy depending on opportunities available. I am 36 , with a PhD in industrial and technology education. Are there pathways to become an army reserve officer? Not asking bcos I want to expedite citizenship.  But because I want to consider the possibilities of actually serving"

But I am still 6 months in my conditional residency, after a year or two I need to apply for I-751. More money and a lot of waiting. After that, I need to wait another 3 years to apply for citizenship. Need to pay and to tons of paperwork again. Time is something valuable to me. I did it in 7 weeks and costed me 0$."

My immigration attorney didn’t tell me that we need that many pages of photos.

Our appointment was 7am, our officer asked us similar questions. We have been together almost 7 years, married for one. We have a huge file as well but he didn’t really want to look through it all. Most of it was in our online filing too tho, so im hoping that’s the reason. He said they can’t do same day approvals, and said they’d get back to us in 2-3 weeks. Our interview was really only about maybe 40 mins long, and they mostly asked my husband the questions. I’m hopeful for a good result and our officer did say he thinks we should be fine. But I hope people reading this can see that it’s okay to not get a same day approval, everyone’s case is different. Though we also are not DACA so difference in our case with that too. But, Congrats to you and your wife! I am sure it’s very relieving. Holding onto hope for us 🥲"

I would have jumped at the opportunity to do a same-day oath. But then we really enjoyed the separate scheduled ceremonies my wife and I got to have with our kids and even friends and neighbors who make the 4-hour trip to Philadelphia to be there for my wife’s oath ceremony.

(My wife and I have applied within minutes of one another, but her case took two months longer than mine despite being simpler.)

The U.S. economy is dynamic and not zero-sum: when one individual obtains a job, it does not mean another individual loses a job. In fact, immigrants help grow the economy by filling labor needs, purchasing goods, and paying taxes. When more people work, productivity increases. This includes both legal and illegal immigrants. Most illegal immigrants become so not because they snuck over the border, but because their travel visa ran out and they overstayed their Visa while waiting to become legal as the process has stalled in recent years. And that started with Trump again.

Refugees and asylum seekers are different! Most refugees wait longer than anybody to come to the United States and are subject to the highest security vetting of all immigrants, not to mention they have to spend that time waiting in refugee camps. And then when they get here, it's incredibly difficult to get a travel document and they have to wait even more years to bring any family left behind."
1iy4e95,metg6im,u/cyrilzeiss,2025-02-26T02:29:32+00:00,1,"We need more immigration judges who would decide cases promptly (not after 5 or 6 years of wait which on its own creates a lot of problems i.e. children who grew up here, connections, etc) based on their real grounds and more subject experts who can provide a good background based on the country of origin.

Unfortunately, there are just too many applicants who abuse the system and are not real refugees. Who's real? A person who's desperately afraid for their life, not just those who can't make ends meet financially. To say that someone is anti-refugee is to completely reject the idea that there are abuses and the system has to be improved. Just check how many refugees asking if it's okay for their status if they visit their family back home. It's just ridiculous.

It's not only about USCIS resources but they are being affected too."

Gaining asylum in the USA is as legal as gaining a greencard through marriage, family, or employment.  It's a legitimate process. To add to that, when people fear for their lives and well-being and have a genuine case for asylum, they will seek out countries that will allow them such safety.

A refugee is someone who crosses an international border. Every year the Executive branch decides what the refugee intake number should be for that year; they specify how many people from which countries. After at least 2 years of security and medical screening, refugees are flown to one of 7 US Ports of Entry (airports) and transferred to their domestic destination. There they receive support for 3 months from NGOs. Those who claim asylum at the border also claim a genuine fear of return, and are then usually released on parole into the community until the date of their hearing. Which often takes at least 3 years. Contrary to popular belief, the majority DO return for their hearing, as it’s their only way to ensure they can remain legally. Many MANY more come here on certain visas (tourists, students) and illegally overstay their visa."

Ergo, being here illegally OSS one one of many reasons a person is deported under the current regime and with the statistics we do actually get from DHS you can clearly see the number of detentions due to unlawful entry are dwarfed by the number of detentions that come from people who have been charged/convicted or fall in a vague “other” category. We can also see a multiple point rise in detentions prior to conviction which remains consistent with the administration’s belief that habeas corpus is not a constitutional right, which they have stated numerous times and we can see from the number of deported who have never been charged or had an opportunity to address their detention or deportation in either a court of law or immigration court. Given that they are being deported with no judicial or executive quasi-judicial due process, it’s unlikely we will ever get a full account of who has been deported and why, but I believe even so, I’ve given you enough rationale for my comment and you are certainly free to check it against any of the official released statistics or news cases where lawyers are involved (lawyers have a habit of not perjuring themselves in filings on behalf of their clients)."

1ibfp2z,m9r7aas,u/Tryingmybest1986,2025-01-29T02:35:23+00:00,2,"I think you will get a response sooner than that, average is 10 days till you get welcome email from NVC (this is trend I’m seeing in i-130 discord server) and the government site also states: 
Current case creation time frame: As of 27-Jan-25, we are working on cases that were received from USCIS on 15-Jan-25.

Once USCIS sends your I-797 approval notice, they will send your approved petition to the National Visa Center (NVC) for processing. At NVC, we will create your visa case and enter the data from your petition into the system.

After creating your case, we will send you instructions for processing, as well as a Welcome Letter that includes your Case Number and Invoice ID. You will use these numbers to log into our Consular Electronic Application Center (https://ceac.state.gov).

You got really lucky with the approval, so happy for you! NVC is pretty good about timelines as long as your good about gathering and submitting everything they require. After you submit required documents and payments you will be Documentarily qualified(NVC approval). Than your file gets transferred to your embassy and that’s where you have to wait till they give you an interview, depending on your embassy it could be months or years till they actually schedule it. Again the long wait times and back logs are usually from USCIS and embassies. Hope this helped. "

I have two questions:

1. There was a Policy Memo for CSPA that allows you to use the Dates for Filing Chart to calculate the CSPA age. The policy states that the date the visa becomes available for the CSPA calculation is the same date when the visa becomes available for filing, if I-130 petition is approved. My question is, if an F2A applicant files concurrently, but the I-130 is not approved, is the CSPA age frozen based on the date of filing (the Policy Manual states that the age is frozen at the time of filing, but it’s very ambiguous) even though the CSPA age has not been calculated, or is it frozen only until the I-130 petition is approved (making the applicant vulnerable to retrogression)?

I am a fresh LPR (9 days so far) and plan on applying for a reentry permit in 6 months to finish studies in Toronto. I am able to enter the US once every 2 weeks (Buffalo) so that I break 6 and 12 month absence rules. 

I know CBP will be flexible on LPRs for the first 12 months. If I apply for a reentry permit in 6 months, and it takes 12 months or more to process, do I lose my LPR when entering even though I have my receipt in hand and wait on USCIS to adjudicate it? 

Will USCIS deny it if the LPR entered frequently breaking the 6/12 month absence rules but didn’t physically reside?

Edit: for the record, permanent US address will be established, annual tax filings and maintained bank account and statements."

Unless you are indigenous shut your pie hole. Have a lot of nerve to talk about legal and illegal immigrants. Even Ellis Island you just showed up and as far as I have research online currently there is no asylum visa you can enter any port of entry and they file asylum so stop your yapping."

For eg. why can’t a person move to another part of their own country if they have a threat in a specific city, why can’t they claim asylum in neighboring country instead of traveling/walking all the way to US passing many countries in between, another question is if let’s say asylum is granted and person gets GC what happens if they travel to native country, does that asylum get revoked because the basis for asylum was you cannot go back.

The only thing I submitted was the form that came in the mail (page 4) and my green cards(including the expired ones). 
They got us forms to register to vote and resources to apply for passport as well. 
Those taking oath were asked to go in the court room while the families and friends waited in the hallway. When the judge arrived, the families were allowed to join us and were seated next to us throughout the ceremony which was really nice.

It was just a bunch of evidence collecting and paperwork.  Only one RFE because I sent the wrong form for the immunization record. :). My dad said it would be hard to do. It was not. The waiting for approvals was the difficult part.

Now here’s the thing. This isn’t the Mexican government catching migrants. This is the US government catching migrants, possibly hundreds of miles away from the border, and putting them on trains to prisons in Mexico. The US will literally operate US immigration courts in Mexico. The reason is that housing people is expensive and can cause the immigration detention process to fail. So he will literally just be snatching people off the street. Presumably, it starts with people who have Temporary Protection status and the people with criminal records, as these are the easiest people to deport. Second group will be some legal migrants who are considered unworthy of citizenship. For many years, you could live in the country with an immigrant visa. His last term, he came after these people but COVID got in the way.

Would an employer rather hire job hoppers or people who serve the company for many years to come? My company had a voluntary separation program where an employee can ask to receive severance at the next round of layoffs. I know one worker, a US citizen, who opted in and suspect many more did because many coworkers who I saw got laid off, appeared to be US citizens. The proclamation should solve the problem of people gaming the lottery system, but can’t change the structural problem of at will employment and how easy it is for US citizens and green card holders to change jobs. It does not surprise me that software companies favor the stability in employment of foreign workers."

That said, lawsuits lawsuits lawsuits until we can get legislation through that includes objective tests for revocation.

I found two active lawsuits for the administration trying this with Venezuela, and I'm hoping someone initiates one either in general and/or for Haitians, etc.

I would suggest for starters that you reach out to: (a) your state attorney general (if they are not a sycophant), and (b) one or more of the plaintiffs in these cases linked below (these are active cases). Might be good to look up cases from Trump 1.0 as well. There were a few in his first term and those will be informative as well; search those up (I don't have a list on hand) and look through them. Most were successful in forcing DHS to back down and even if they ultimately fail you can buy a lot of time by dragging it through the court.

If there is a Ukrainian and/or immigrants rights group(s) in your area, get with them as well. At a minimum, organize legal counsel (the advocacy groups can help with this, and may be pro bono) and, if possible, get the ball rolling on a lawsuit. Multiple lawsuits originating in multiple states will be vastly more effective than one lawsuit, not to mention the distraction/drain that forces the agency lawyers into court on the defense for weeks or months (that is time they can't spend on offense, and time you can use to further organize).

1j52pmw,mgfozsh,u/KFelts910,2025-03-07T01:32:47+00:00,13,"Thank you. Thank you so much for this comment. I have been chewed out as fear mongering. Slight rant, but one big example is telling people to be cautious about traveling. Some responses were so mean spirited or overly skeptical about my reasons. And come to find out numerous clients and colleagues have experienced being pulled into secondary inspection and treated horribly. A VAWA applicant being interrogated about the abuse she suffered and asked why she didn’t just leave. A man from India denied entry on advance parole and now forced to consular process, and lose his job. He has no indicators of inadmissibility, no criminal record. He was told “nope, you have to finish that up from your country.” CBP has such broad discretion, and once they deny entry, it’s extremely hard to challenge it. None of these things - not TPS, not parole, none of it - are ever guaranteed.

I’m not going to risk my license because a guy’s sister’s friend’s cousin successfully traveled on advance parole with a final order of removal. I will always encourage my clients to be more cautious because at the end of the day, I want them to *win.* 

I’m so sorry this is where we are at everyone. Now isn’t the time to put yourself at risk. AILA has a great list of experienced immigration lawyers. There are also plenty of nonprofits who want to help. Please know that if experienced lawyers are saying something isn’t possible or is risky, and someone else tells you otherwise, to think twice. You are likely being given false promises of hope, in exchange for money. Sometimes there is that one niche miracle. Sometimes it can work out. But the Notarios and “immigration consultants” are in a feeding frenzy right now. The new NTA memo that came out just made sending applications and petitions all the more risky if it’s done wrong. Now? Well, go take a look at the memo for yourself: https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-alerts/NTA_Policy_FINAL_2.28.25_FINAL.pdf

My mother had passed away but I was apprehensive about traveling to my COP and not able to return. About 1 year before this tragedy happened I had already initiated the process for a new RTD. My existing COP passport was still valid. 

I reached out to my immigration attorney at the time to let them know the situation. They said if the RTD does not arrive just go ahead and use your existing COP passport with your green card. As long as you are not frequently traveling there and spending long periods of time there. They had clients who come and go to there COP all the time without issue.

During this time I called USCIS and was able to reach a live person and explained the situation why I needed the RTD expedited. The agent was empathetic and understanding. I was able to get the RTD in the nick of time before the funeral. 

I booked my flight using the RTD and my green card because I didn’t want to use my COP passport. But I didn’t want to board the flight using the RTD. Also, the person at the gate on the last leg of the flight insisted we all show a valid passport. I was not gonna show a loud green document in front of people from my home country and then get potentially pulled aside. I ended up using my COP Passport and was given access to board the flight.

Upon arrival to my COP, going through immigration was a new issue. I wanted to avoid in person immigration so I tried using the KIOSK in the airport. But my COP passport was not registering. I ended up asking an immigration official for assistance. When they tried to process my entry, they got the same error too. They turned around and asked me, do you have another passport?

I hesitated for a minute then answered no. They asked why did you take so long to answer? I responded I have a green card. They then took me to an immigration personnel who then processed my entry and stamped my COP. I would never show the RTD because that I think would be considered offensive and could get me pulled aside for questioning. 

I got through immigration and was able to return to my home town for the funeral. My flight was scheduled to leave the same day of the funeral. I used the COP passport to board the return flight and upon arrival I presented my RTD to US immigration and my green card. I was processed and permitted entry without issue. 

Earlier this week I became a US citizen but my trip back to my COP was a cause for concern and I did list it in my N-400 application as the only international trip I took. During the interview it was never brought up. I was only asked if I ever stayed outside the country for more than 6 months. Answer was No and that was it.

Now keep in mind this was under the Biden administration and I had a green card, extremely valid circumstance to travel, I returned with death certificate and funeral program. Trump administration all cards are off the table. So, you really have to think through this carefully."

multiple things can be true. you *should* be able to travel without issue as long as you stay within the perimeters you are already familiar with. you’ll *probably* be fine, as many people are doing that without issue every day. however, i’m the kind of immigration caseworker who only gets called in when something goes really wrong, so from my pov even if the risk is low, it’s never low enough. in the unlikely event that you have an issue…it’s going to be more than one bad day.

if i were you, i probably wouldn’t take the risk of traveling internationally unless it was for a reason that i’d thought about extensively and decided outweighs the potential risk - like an “i will regret this for the rest of my life if i don’t” scenario. that said, nobody lives life with 0 risk. random bad things happen all the time, regardless of immigration status, and we can all only do so much to mitigate that. everyone has their own risk threshold and considerations to make, and i wish you only good things as you make yours. 💜"

1o2xb0y,nirvsxd,u/ImmigrationLaw32,2025-10-10T14:00:41+00:00,-4,"I don't believe any of these Russian claims for asylum and I have helped on two different successful applications. Of course, 15 months ago we didn't know about Trump reelection, but now they are looking at revoking Russian asylee's status.

Russia is a safe country, even for political dissidents if you just keep quiet. Asylum is for those facing immediate harm, but Russia is very predictable. It's marginally more dangerous than US politics, so unless you are Snowden level, asylum makes no sense.

The cases I helped on were people related to Nemtsov's death. Very thin claims. Even Nemtsov himself was safe if he didn't cross the red lines that were obvious to him.

Just my opinion. I think it's a bigger risk than OP is giving credit for in getting this and others should careful consider the risks. Traveling won't affect things now, but the RTD application itself could be used against OP."

My only last living parent passed away last month, and I have applied for a US travel document. Typically, I will go to my senator to expedite it for me and that has always worked, but now that the govt is shutdown, I’m not even sure how to go about it and I have never traveled with my COP and I haven’t had my COP in over 10 years. I don’t even know how to go about getting a new one without it being a complicated  process, but I believe that there are exceptions when there’s a death in  your immediate family, so sad.  I hate that one has to go through grief and anxiety at the same time just because it’s not really clear how to navigate situations like this. The funeral date has been set and I don’t even have a passport. It’s in two months."

That’s what we don’t know. OP claims to be aware of the prohibition of traveling to a country where they were unsafe, so perhaps their sick relative had escaped to a third country. That’s a very common scenario among refugees, of course."

1miu8z1,n78dvg4,u/KeyAd1664,2025-08-06T13:56:33+00:00,7,"Yes they all handle it.

First day of basic military training, the naturalization applicant trainees are identified. Throughout the weeks, trainees would meet with the USCIS liaison so everyone is in the same page with the application. 

They will make you sign the N426 form, they’ll then take it and route to the commander to sign it, and will give it back to you to make your final packet. All of the applications are online. And are streamlined. It is very easy, you just need to follow what the liaison is telling you.

The day before you graduate, you will then take the naturalization test and interview, and have a small ceremony on the office. The next day, you will be recognized during graduation.

Good to note that this is my experience with the Air Force, other branches may differ slightly."
1miu8z1,n78slwc,u/KeyAd1664,2025-08-06T15:08:10+00:00,3,"for Air Force, its a yes and no. 

They give you options on what job you are eligible for. After that, you will have to wait if a job from those list is available. Some jobs maybe available immediately, or some takes months or years. All depends on the needs of the Air Force.

For me, I just went for the immediate available job."

Many folks have obtained US citizenship in the military and served 20+ years and retired. I personally know a few while in the service who retired as Master Chiefs and Senior Chiefs. Don't get me wrong... yes there are those who join just to get citizenship but it's not good to assume..."
1miu8z1,n77jg8t,u/KeyAd1664,2025-08-06T10:49:35+00:00,10,"Oh, we get this question a lot:
“Why did you join the military?”

Some will say education benefits.
Others will say housing, stability, traveling, getting away from a dead-end job.
Rarely, and I mean RARELY, do you find someone who wakes up and says,
“I want to join the military because I love doing push-ups and following orders.”

People join for opportunities.
But what matters is that when you’re in, you show up and serve.

I didn’t join for an easy way out.
If you think boot camp, deployments, and wearing the uniform every day is a shortcut,
You clearly haven’t been in long enough.

The military doesn’t care why you joined.
It cares that you earn your place, pull your weight, and uphold the mission.
And that’s exactly what I’m doing."

Birth certificate doesn’t count now. You need to prove that your mother was in lawful status when you were born. Ok, but how do you do that? Her birth certificate isn’t de facto proof either, you need to prove that your grandma was in lawful status at the time of her birth. etc. etc. 

And you don’t just need to prove they’re a citizen. You need to prove they were a citizen at the time of your/her birth. 

The only way this could work is if the Federal government creates a national database of all citizens, immigrant or not.

A child born in Britain is not eligible automatically for British citizenship, one of the parents has to prove legal residency for over 5 years (I’m not sure if that has changed) for the child to be allowed to have a British passport. I know this because I used to work with a Polish lady who did not have her Indefinite Leave to Remain (that is permanent residency in the UK) at the time her son was born, therefore she had to have  a Polish passport issued for her son. I on the other hand, American citizen living in the UK with ILR at the time my child was born, was able to apply for my son’s British passport as soon as I got his birth certificate from the register office. If I were to apply this system into what the current administration wants to do, I’d say that every American Citizen has to prove either one of their parents was a legal resident at the time they were born (certified copies of GC numbers or any evidence of letters issued from IO etc,  and if the parents are American born then, a birth certificate will suffice."

I think he is just trying to show a certain part of his base that he tried, but was stopped by the courts because his executive order is unconstitutional. If he were really serious about ending the “Anchor Baby” phenomenon, he would just issue an executive order that would declare parents of US citizens are no considered Immediate Relatives. That declaration would not be considered unconstitutional. However, he probably won’t do that because it is a fact that Americans don’t have enough babies to sustain our economy. The fact is that the USA needs immigrants for demographic purposes. Americans don’t even reproduce enough to maintain the current population, and the economy needs the population to increase in order for capitalism to continue.

In case you don’t understand my logic, here is a simple explanation. If we had no immigration, the U.S. population would decrease every year just like Japan. As the population decreases, the government will receive less income tax every year. If it receives less income tax, how can the government sustain programs like Social Security and Medicare, especially since most of the population would become elderly. Also, consider the fact that if the population starts decreasing companies such as McDonald’s will sell fewer and fewer burgers every year. If the population starts imploding, property values would start decreasing, causing a decrease in the collection of property taxes."

A birth certificate is a states rights issue they defend dearly. Not everyone born in the US to American citizen parents have a birth certificate. Not uncommon amongst home births in remote or poor areas with unassisted home births. Tribal birth registration is rather more complicated and birth registration may be help by a variety of document types by state or tribal entities. There is not national database for birth certificates and many states, both blue and red would block this be court order within the federal district for their state. Then there’s the issue of birth certificates for children dropped off under safe haven laws. There is no citizenship or even parent’s name to register on the birth certificate. The reason that other countries like the UK or France manage to not have birthright citizenship is because there is a federal birth certificate mechanism. Such a thing does not exist in the US and never will at birth registration is a state’s right, heavily defended by many states.

They're inventing the registration procedure from whole cloth. There's nothing in the immigration laws that authorizes it. The reason why the immigration laws don't say anything about people born in the US having to register for status is that when the laws were written, it was well understood that  those people would be citizens, so there was no need for them to acquire status.

USCIS is correct that a procedure is already in place for those who are born with diplomatic immunity. However, people born with diplomatic immunity don't *have to* register for status. They're already immune to immigration laws unless the US revokes their parents' diplomatic credentials. The registration procedure is only used if they want to subject themselves to US jurisdiction and remain permanently."

It’s not because Trump wants to get rid of American citizens. It’s because millions of people have used the birthright citizenship loophole to drop anchor babies in the U.S and stay here illegally because of their new dependent. 

Name another country on the planet that allows this level of blatant disregard for its immigration system. 

This has obviously been a problem for a long time and it’s no wonder that it’s finally being addressed. Instead of griping about the legislation cuz, “its bad mmkay” why don’t you offer another solution that would stop illegal immigrants from having children here outside of legal status in an attempt to stay here ILLEGALLY. 

It’s unfair to everyone else that’s doing it the right way- including my wife.

There are so many ways for this to go wrong, and given the incompetence and disdain for minorities this current Admin has shown, they would likely look for loopholes to get rid of undesirables.

Do parents need to submit documents to a federal agency run by Stephen Miller for evaluation prior to citizenship issuance? How do we trust the federal department to process them quickly or in good faith? If it gets backlogged, could it take years to verify? If they don't like the name of the applicant, or the parents voting record, will they delay processing or misplace the application?  Keep in mind Miller is encouraging law enforcement to break the law in regards to racial profiling, detainment and due process.

What happens to orphans when the parent's cannot be identified? Are the babies deported to a 3rd party country where they will either be trafficked or killed?

What happens to the child from the time of birth until the citizenship application is processed? Are they barred from citizenship benefits? Could they be detained and deported?

How do the parents prove citizenship if they were born in America and only have a birth certificate? Are birth certificates only valid as proof of citizenship if they are dated prior to the EO?

What if a US citizen has lost their birth certificate or passport or changed their name? Do they need to go through the potentially long and arduous process of pulling all the records together before the child will be considered a citizen?"
1maq0ho,n5gvwf0,,2025-07-27T17:46:22+00:00,5,Very easy actually. They just issue ‘non-citizen certificate of birth’ just like driver licenses and that’s it.

1m48nbx,n43l3qx,u/throwaway0845reddit,2025-07-20T02:17:35+00:00,0,"The only explanation: he had visa. He applied for i485. Case receipt not received or case is processing. Visa expired, he stayed. Now after some time his case goes pending (processed but waiting). Now he is allowed to stay until approval or  denial. But since he overstayed before pending, he’s in trouble"
1m48nbx,n4se07l,,2025-07-23T21:25:42+00:00,1,Sorry about your situation. What was the reason for the delay? What is the visa you are trying to get her in?
1m48nbx,n42ugpu,u/PDXoutrehumor,2025-07-19T23:30:44+00:00,9,"Generally, marriage to a US citizen and a properly and timely filed I-485 application creates lawful presence or “authorized stay” that would preclude removal proceedings during adjudication. And at adjudication, an overstay is generally forgiven for spouses of US citizens.

Even so, if the facts are correct that he graduated in March 2021, entered OPT, and married in July 2021 and filed I-130 and I-485 concurrently, there was never an overstay and he was never out of status."

The exception was during the pandemic as my visa expired and I couldn't travel to reapply. In fact, they closed the embassy I had my interview 1 day before it (currently, there is no working US embassy in my country).

  
I had come and gone to the USA since that date at least twice every year. Sometimes up to 18 times as I needed to pass twice while coming and going to Bahamas for work. I also had a H1b Visa and worked legally there for 2 years, but decided not to renew as having a H1 Visa can be really close to indenture slavery as your employee does not treat you very well (your visa is attached to it so if you actually want to stay you have little to zero leverage). Besides, I didn't really liked the system. Nice to visit, but not my cup of tea to live in. 

But now I'm scared to go trade shows, customer's visits and even to visit family members that (legally) live there. From US citizens to residents to ones with granted asylum. I have no idea if they are going to void stamp my visa, or reduce it to a month, for example. This is not fair or just. I have no blame on whatever ill things my crap government do. I do suffer from my government decisions and actions, but I moved to an island on our coast so as not to as affected as most, specially from violence. I work out of country (mostly to Europe lately) so as not to suffer from our economic realities. And I definitely don't want to move to USA, as I had demonstrated time and time again throughout my life. This is super frustrating for me. I already lost Infocomm out of fear of going. I guess I'll keep on going to ISE Barcelona instead, where I feel welcomed and my money is well appreciated."

During Trump’s last term, [green card holders](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-green-card-dual-citizens/index.html) got stuck in international terminals when Trump signed the executive order of the Muslim ban and it went into effect while they were traveling from/were passport holders of those banned countries. I am sure the majority of them were law abiding.


Also, [mass deportations](https://calendar.eji.org/racial-injustice/jul/15) of family units (including US born citizens) have occurred in previous administrations.

Edit: For clarity"

I have no idea what would happen to undocumented immigrants, but I sincerely hope that the administration would abide by the law. I say that with unreasonable optimism. It's worth considering that many of these people arrived in the US very long ago, many over 30 years ago, so removing them and sending them somewhere else is not only cruel and impractical, but would also hit their local communities too much. Not that it would stop them, but it's a much bigger endeavor than just turning people away at the border.   
  
For legal, especially work-based applicants, tweaks like doing more interviews, slowing down processing and kicking out cases for a missed comma on a form are very likely coming. Something more draconian - like canceling some categories or drastically reducing the numbers requires congressional approval which seems unlikely, mostly because the businesses would be mad. 

  
It's a sad reality that we now have to live with this asshole in chief, but the best thing we can do is to play by the rules, get naturalized and then vote the asshole out. Ultimately, that's ""the American"" way. I left my home country because I felt so hopeless about its future that I didn't think that I could live there and contribute to its economy in good conscious. It is currently proving me right on a daily basis. So I will continue living here in the US and jumping through as many stupid hoops as they require until I either get my passport or lose faith in this society. I haven't yet."

For example when it comes to birthright citizenship it doesn’t apply during “an invasion” which is what Trump calls what is happening at the southern border. Who knows how the Supreme “Court” will rule on that.

As for green cards / citizenship the government can go back and look at past records if they want and there are no guardrails at the Supreme Court.

It’s ok for people to be scared. I understand."

- Trump ends birthright citizenship to those born to illegals by executive order, instructing federal agencies to deny benefits to those affected, e.g. Social Security, passport, etc.
- Trump is sued to challenge the executive order
- Trump wins
- The resulting judgement could potentially be applied retroactively to anyone born in the US to illegals (although unlikely)
- Suddenly 10 million people approx have been stripped of their citizenship.

This doesn’t require any amendment to the constitution. It just requires a case to get to scotus and for them to say the citizenship clause does not apply to people born to illegals and it never has."

The 2019 budget review for ICE specifically discussed its intention to review the files of 700,000 citizens ([source](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf). This presumably never happened due to COVID grinding everything to a halt, but it very clearly proves their intention to investigate and potentially denaturalize on a scale we’ve never experienced before. The ACLU further discusses it [here](https://immpolicytracking.org/media/documents/ACLU_Fact_Sheet_on_Denaturalization.pdf). The bit about being a “member of or affiliated with a subversive group” is particularly concerning to me as Trump has frequently referred to Democrats as “the enemy”, so how can we be certain registered democrats wouldn’t be added to that list? I mean I hope I’m wrong but it’s absurd to hand waive these concerns as baseless fear mongering."

In other words ICE doesn't know how many US citizens they arrest, detain or deport because they simply don't have records on it. 

""As a result, ICE does not know the extent to which its officers are taking enforcement actions against individuals who could be U.S. citizens. By systematically collecting and maintaining electronic data, ICE would have better insight into its officers’ enforcement of administrative immigration law.

Available data indicate ICE and CBP took enforcement actions against some U.S. citizens. For example, available ICE data indicate that ICE arrested 674, detained 121, and removed 70 potential U.S. citizens from fiscal year 2015 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 (March 2020).""

""available ICE data indicate""  --> Now read sentence one again: ""By systematically collecting and maintaining electronic data \[ICE could tell how many potential US citizens were affected\]""

But I am sure nobody needs to be concerned if government's own auditor \[GOA\] finds that another government agency \[ICE\] obviously violates the rights of US citizens and doesn't even keep proper records who they deported.

You are however making an assumption that the Supreme Court won’t rule with an alternative interpretation. Some would say that an executive order, escalated to the Supreme Court COULD be interpreted differently, impacting future births. A lot of the prior cases on 14th are very old.

That said, I do have faith that it’s strong enough to not change via SCOTUS. It would be too brazen of an overreach to rule otherwise. Maybe they don’t care, but I think they do if the laws don’t provide wiggle room. SCOTUS do have numerous examples of saying if the law needs changing then Congress should do that vs the courts.

For example, Most pre-election law interpretations follow a literal interpretation as they’re pretty black and white. 

There’s certainly less room for creative interpretation towards whatever biases the justices may have, vs there was with Abortion. 

If someone present and born here is not “subject to the jurisdiction “ of the US, then whose jurisdiction are they under?

The 14th is very generous and may be worth revisiting, but through law not the courts."

Scary shit. And they’re trying to set precedent so they can do it to anyone. Even US citizens.

This administration is stating they are above the law. And their current “undesirables” are immigrants, legal or not. Canceling green cards or student visas because of political views, simply means that this administration believes non-citizens do not have freedom of speech.

An executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship could theoretically be issued by a U.S. president, but it would face immediate legal challenges and likely be blocked by the courts. Here’s how such a scenario might play out:

1. Issuing the Executive Order
	•	A president might attempt to interpret or redefine the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the 14th Amendment via executive order. For example, the order could state that children of undocumented immigrants or non-citizens are not automatically granted citizenship.
	•	However, executive orders are limited in scope and cannot override or reinterpret the Constitution. The 14th Amendment clearly establishes birthright citizenship, as upheld in cases like United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898).

2. Immediate Legal Challenges
	•	The executive order would likely face lawsuits from civil rights groups, state governments, or affected individuals as soon as it is issued.
	•	Federal courts, including district and appellate courts, would evaluate the order’s constitutionality.

3. Temporary Enforcement?
	•	In theory, the executive order could stay in place until a court issues an injunction or a ruling to halt its enforcement. However:
	•	Courts often issue temporary restraining orders (TROs) or preliminary injunctions to block controversial or unconstitutional orders while legal proceedings are ongoing.
	•	Given the strong legal precedent supporting birthright citizenship, courts are highly likely to block such an order quickly.

4. Supreme Court Resolution
	•	Ultimately, the matter would likely escalate to the Supreme Court, which would decide whether the executive order is constitutional.
	•	Given existing precedent (e.g., Wong Kim Ark), the Supreme Court would almost certainly strike down such an order, reaffirming that birthright citizenship cannot be ended by executive action.

Key Points:
	•	While an executive order might briefly stay in place, its enforcement would be temporary at best and highly contentious.
	•	Courts are likely to block such an order quickly, as it directly contradicts the 14th Amendment.
	•	Lasting changes to birthright citizenship require a constitutional amendment or a Supreme Court ruling—not an executive order.

In short, an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship would not stand for long due to robust constitutional protections and legal challenges."

\- You are born in the US to two H1B/H4 parents.... you aren't a citizen, PR and have no status. How do they consider unlawful presence? Intuitively you can't punish the child in this fact pattern and also they are eligible for a derivative visa but how long does one have to apply? When does the lack of status become an issue? The existing rules are all based on last lawful entry but you don't have one. Are you legal as long as you don't leave but need a visa to return?

This EO becoming law would require a fundamental rework to existing immigration laws to sanely implement to the extent it applies to parents with lawful status. It would have been far more logical if it excluded children born on B1/B2 to capture birth tourism. But capturing children born to parents on long-term nonimmigrant visas doesn't make a lot of sense without a bunch of additional rulemaking."

I take it that your Affidavit of Support was the issue because your husband didn’t have the means to support you and you didn’t find another sponsor.  You triggered the ban when you departed the US if you were not removed.  It is harder to qualify for the waiver once the ban is triggered.

Now that he left the US, the ban is automatic and will run for 10 years from the date of departure. It's going to be pretty hard to get a waiver (you need to show exceptional hardship to the USC spouse).. Waivers are taking years right now anyway.

You might just save the effort and money and apply closer to the 10 year mark."

Yes, an overstay bar can be waived, but you're probably gonna struggle to get any sort of visitor visa because you already applied to adjust status, were denied, and would be coming back in with him, which just looks like you'd be trying to stay. You can ask to waive the overstay bar during the process of applying for your visitor visa but the format doesn't make it easy to do so admittedly."

But yes it was a mistake for leaving and triggering the bar. Now you need the 212 waiver I believe. But if the USC is living with you abroad, it will be difficult to show hardship."
1m7nfg6,n4tqtmr,u/Ant_mor3,2025-07-24T01:54:45+00:00,1,"I also overstayed for over a year while we were figuring out our finances (for the affidavit), we ended up having my sister in law being my sponsor and got approved. We did try an attorney to help us with the process, who was just sucking our money and almost got me in trouble... we dumped them and figured it out ourselves... 
It's difficult to find an honest, reliable attorney, but it really sounds like that's what you need... Hope you figure it out! Good luck !!"
1m7nfg6,n4ubmpe,u/CXZ115,2025-07-24T04:08:57+00:00,1,"You can apply for an I-212 waiver with CBP. If approved, you can visit the US temporarily just like a regular Canadian would. I believe that waiver is valid for 5 years and can be renewed. It does take time to be given a decision, 6 months or more probably. There are many agents that provide this service in Canada. Good luck.

If you want to immigrate and get a green card however, your husband needs to file the I-130, then you have to appear for a consular interview, be denied, then ask for an I-601 waiver which takes years to be approved and you have to show extreme hardship so probably not applicable in your case since your husband is clearly doing well in Canada.

Honestly, it sounds like you'll be better off waiting the 5 years remaining on the 10 year ban. You can probably apply for the I-130 a year or so before the ban expires. That way when the immigrant visa interview is scheduled in Montreal, you'll be eligible to get it right after the ban expires. In the meantime, you can apply for the I-212 with CBP which will help you visit temporarily, that is, if approved of course."

Honestly your attorney should have filed a motion to open the case again. You are saying you had a joint sponsor. This seems like your attorneys fault. Did you even do any research? 

There is literally a K1 visa. You could have left the USA, and done an AOS based on that.

1m7nfg6,n4tjtuh,u/Crimson_2340,2025-07-24T01:14:00+00:00,1,"Are you sure the 10 year ban applies? It’s not clear from the facts you stated. 

You’re barred from reentering the U.S. for 10 years if you were “unlawfully present” in the U.S. for a year or more. Generally, you don’t accrue unlawful presence while an I-485 is pending. If you overstayed for a year and then filed your I-485, you would have triggered the 10 year bar when you left. If you filed the I-485 before you overstayed for a year (and you left shortly after the I-485 was denied), you might not have accrued one year of unlawful presence/might not be subject to the 10 year bar. 

That said, if you had six months or more of unlawful presence, you might have been subject to the three year bar, but that would have expired by now if you left in 2020.

Assuming you are subject to the 10 year bar, it’s likely going to be tough if things are generally going well for you and your husband in Canada. Also, since you’re halfway through the bar, it probably makes more sense to wait it out than deal with the headache of a waiver.

Sounds like you should talk to an attorney (maybe a new attorney because a denial based on an insufficient I-864 with a joint sponsor really shouldn’t happen unless the applicant has a history of using government benefits) to confirm if you’re subject to the bar or not, and go from there. If you don’t have all your prior records, your attorney should file a FOIA to double check all the dates."

Exciting times for sure...

Besides SS, Real-ID update, Voter ID & Passport, I would strongly recommend getting a PassportCard as well - just $30 extra but pretty useful. Wallet sized like Real-ID. Great to have it all the times on you in the current immigration scenario.

You can Drive to Canada / Mexico or even enjoy Caribbean cruises just on PP card no Passport needed unless you are flying. You may Google Passport Card to do more reasearch.

Also don't forget GLOBAL ENTRY pass - if you are a frequent International traveler. Great value - fast clearance from Airports into US. Fee $120 for 5 yr validity.

So if someone is looking for you they will cross over and take you. You are only safe as long as you’re incognito which there is no guarantee. In a lot of countries in South America, because so many people in Venezuela are fleeing for their lives, there is prejudice against them in a lot of places. Not to mention if you’re darker skinned there is racism. People who come here to seek asylum still believe in the American dream as that was what we as the US sold to the rest of America. They see hope and safety and stability. People get disappeared, kidnapped, and killed in these other countries when they are just trying to do the right thing. And now we are starting to do the same to them and send some of them back to conditions that are torture and not just economically, but police brutality and arrests based on nothing or accusations of dissent and gangs targeting them. In Mexico they are not safe either due to them being targets trafficking and robberies. These are human beings. Not every migrants is lying or cheating the system or whatever. They just believe America is the safest (which in some ways it is) and will protect them. No one wants to fuck with Americas military so if they cross here it is safer.

Golden visa is not intended to be a path to citizenship.

It's not a replacement for EB 5, even though it will effectively replace it.

Trump is allowing the uber wealthy of the world to live in the US and travel abroad like citizens, without the restrictions of a green card, such as the six-month limit on stays outside the US, or the risk of losing permanent residency for not pursuing citizenship after a few years.

Offer all the benefits of citizenship without the obligation to pay taxes on global income and without voting rights (but they get something more powerful than voting)

It's a more convenient path for the ultra wealthy around the world to more easily lobby, influence, and even bribe at all levels of the US government (Just buy your team of puppet politicians, why the hell do you need to vote for one)

I wouldn't be surprised if, under his administration, gold visa holders are treated like diplomats, effectively beyond the reach of the American judicial system

I wouldn't be surprised if, in a few years, we find out that the richest Americans with significant global income have renounced their citizenship in favor of the golden visa."

1jr4gn4,mldl570,u/MAGA-2025,2025-04-04T14:12:05+00:00,1,"My best guess is it would be under current schemes authorized by INA specifically EB1. 

USCIS has the power to define who is eligible for EB1 classification and currently you need to meet 3 out of a bunch of qualifications one of which is possess high salary. 

They could go through the rule making process to add one more qualifications which is spend 5 million dollars will qualify you as EB1. 

Also the law is silent on how applicants shall be processed. Under EB1 USCIS could again in the same rule making process propose to add gold card queue in front of the other candidates as it's not required by law to do FIFO processing. That way gold card candidates most likely won't be subject to numeric limitations (in practice) assuming there are not that many applicants (such that the total gold card issuance exceed the entire EB1 country and category quota)

That would be my best guess. 

of course, they can also do similar things to the EB5 program  but IMO EB1 is the best fit and require the least changes. 

All of the above requires nothing from Congress and well within the authorities of the executive branch. The Congress has laws offering the classification it's up to the President to decide how those classifications are implemented."

1jr4gn4,mle10rx,u/PineappleGuy7,2025-04-04T15:31:51+00:00,2,"It's not intended to be a path to citizenship.

It's not a replacement for EB 5, even though it will effectively replace it.

Trump is allowing the uber wealthy of the world to live in the US and travel abroad like citizens, without the restrictions of a green card, such as the six-month limit on stays outside the US, or the risk of losing permanent residency for not pursuing citizenship after a few years.

Offer all the benefits of citizenship without the obligation to pay taxes on global income and without voting rights (but they get something more powerful than voting)

It's a more convenient path for the ultra wealthy around the world to more easily lobby, influence, and even bribe at all levels of the US government (Just buy your team of puppet politicians, why the hell do you need to vote for one)

Edit 1: I wouldn't be surprised if, under his administration, gold visa holders are treated like diplomats, effectively beyond the reach of the American judicial system

Edit 2: I wouldn't be surprised if, in a few years, we find out that the richest Americans with significant global income have renounced their citizenship in favor of the golden visa."

Also why are you still using parole based EAD c(11) aren’t you eligible for TPS? Once you have TPS you no longer on parole and should update category to tps based EAD"
1k2muxb,mnzige8,u/UAAKLaw,2025-04-19T20:48:05+00:00,9,"I’ve filed hundreds of parole/ead/tps applications and here is what I can share regarding this:

They stopped approving parole applications starting October 2024. Not a single one I filed was approved. I heard some people got their parole approved after that date though. EADs were still okay at that time.

The best possible position to be right now is if one filed tps and had approved EAD. That allows these individuals to refile for TPS( if the previous one is approved) and refile for renewed EAD (receipt notice extends the old card).

Unfortunately there is nothing we can do at this moment except to wait. I am wondering what will happen to those whose parole will expire this summer/fall and who did not qualify for TPS?"
1k2muxb,mnvlgt1,u/Negative_Yogurt4254,2025-04-19T04:19:54+00:00,20,"Hi! I'm a Ukrainian on TPS and C-19 EAD. It expires today (April 19), but since President Biden's executive order on TPS extension has not been terminated yet, I applied for this TPS extension but instead of applying for a new EAD valid for 540 days, I just chose automatic 365-day extension.

When the time came to update my I-9 record at the university where I work, I simply presented my soon-to-expire EAD and this Federal Register Notice where it explicitly says that my EAD is automatically extended: [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-00771/extension-of-the-designation-of-ukraine-for-temporary-protected-status](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-00771/extension-of-the-designation-of-ukraine-for-temporary-protected-status) See Section A under ""What documentation may I present to my employer for Form I-9 if I am already employed but my current TPS-related EAD is set to expire?"" I am planning to return to Ukraine at the end of June, though, and basically need / will use this automatically extended EAD for two months only.

Perhaps this automatic extension applies to many people in your group, and they don't know that they could benefit from it without paying the fee and applying for a new EAD? Employers might not know about it, either, that's why this Federal Register Notice addresses the most common queries and situations + explains to both employees and employers how to handle this situation. Hope it helps!"

The situation on my progress has been the same for more than 3 months, I believe. It's still step 3 of 3—case decision. Only now it's showing that it's going to take another 3 months, and the estimated time is only increasing...a couple of weeks ago it was 2 months. 

I've applied for the third time, and honestly both times it was pretty fast, in the way it can be with USCIS (any immigration system in any country works slowly). This time is completely different, and I am sure you understand why. Although, I must say, one of the gentlemen I know was waiting for his EAD approval for more than 8 months, and it was 2023... There's something about luck as well, I guess. Sounds wild, and yet. 

I got messages from people (Ukrainian groups) that some of them got their TPS and U4U renewals...just now, about a week ago or so. However, I haven't heard anything about employment authorization. I am looking for a lawyer or someone who can give me more options than just doing nothing, filing more inquiries, and waiting for another year or so, when they finally decide to proceed with my case. Don't stop.

It’s FROZEN they’re not processing nothing for any person who came on CHNV/U4U 
They put it on hold /Paused"

Nothing is moving. Nothing is being approved. We’ve been cut off entirely, without warning, without explanation. That’s not a backlog. That’s a ban. And if you can’t tell the difference, then you’ve clearly never had your existence erased by a system that doesn’t even bother to say ‘no’ — it just stops speaking"
1k2muxb,mnvnrmu,u/Cute_Matter5031,2025-04-19T04:38:24+00:00,7,"You don’t get it. They froze all application. Even for spouses, work visas, ead cards. It’s not like we can’t wait. They just ignore us and all our cases. In a last 3 month there was 0 approval for any cases for Ukrainians"
1k2muxb,mnvksnr,u/Cute_Matter5031,2025-04-19T04:14:43+00:00,7,I didn’t know that we have to ask a permission to be alive and it’s a privilege. They can just close the program and ask us to leave instead of putting freeze on AOS and EAD card and keep collecting funds for processing.

I know many people use their visa or ESTA to do some under the table work, but it's not allowed and these are the consequences. I don't know what makes them hold you for 12 days vs just being sent back like the french scientist/others.

Did they mention if it's for the 130 or the 485?"
1n1mcij,nbsmjih,u/blue-Angel1984,2025-09-01T06:28:56+00:00,5,"Yo soy nicaragüense entre con parole humanitario luego de un año de estar acá conocí a mi esposo el es americano y en corto tiempo decidimos vivir juntos a los 5 meses de vivir juntos en marzo nos casamos, mi divorcio de mi anterior matrimonio salió en febrero y ya llevaba varios años separada de el.

Nos casamos  a finales de marzo y a el 10 de abril  presentamos por correo el combo completo de solicitud. I-130 -I-131 I-485 I-765, el examen medico ( que no recuerdo la I-cual es) y la solicitud de notificación por mensajes y correos. 5 de mayo fuimos ala cita de la biometria, a inicios de julio me programaron la primera entrevista que seria para el 28 de agosto y a los 2 dias la cancelaron, luego a inicios de agosto me programaron otra entrevista para el 11 de septiembre y ala semana la cancelaron 6 días después fue la visita sorpresa de migración alas 6am. 

No me sentí intimidada por la presencia de ellos somos una pareja legítima y nos casamos por amor, la casa tenía fotos nuestras por todos lados y como vivimos solos pues solo hay cosas de el y mias, 3 cuartos pero solo una cama, lógicamente dormimos juntos, compartimos closet baños y todo. Preguntaron donde estaba mi ropa y el se la mostro que la ropa de ambos esta en el mismo cuarto , que compartimos el mismo closet en nuestro cuarto hay 10 fotos grandes donde solo salimos el y yo. 

Todas sus preguntas los contestamos en la sala de la casa y yo en toalla 🫣 . Por que acababa de despertar. Mostramos cada rinconcito de la casa incluso el patio donde tengo mi huerto. Vieron ambos carros en la parte de enfrente, pero aun no actualizaron nada , en ninguna de las aplicaciones. Seguimos orando a Jehová para que nos den una respuesta positiva pronto, por que la verdad no sabría vivir si me llegaran a separar de mi esposo. Y a 5 meses casi y aun no me envian el permiso de trabajo, ese es renovación pero ahora bajo categoría diferente por el matrimonio ."

1n1mcij,nb0ozvj,u/AkiraMcCloud03,2025-08-27T21:07:11+00:00,3,"FDNS (Fraud Detection National Security directorate under CIS). The investigative side of the house for CIS. From what I've heard the best pure investigators within DHS. Visit sounds like it went well for you two. They would have shown badges, credentials and fully identified themselves. Early morning is the best time for them to make contact with you. Or on the weekend. You handled this perfectly. Cooperated, showed everything they asked to see, and answered all their questions. They are used to half naked people, smelly breath, and messy homes, so nothing to think twice about. Chances are they already knew they would find both of you at the residence. Just needed to document the evidence and show photos to adjudications for a favorable decision. Well done!"
1n1mcij,nb0epnu,u/UnanimousControversy,2025-08-27T20:18:55+00:00,2,"It was the fraud unit and it means they at least had some suspicions of possible fraud.  It could be the red flags you mentioned. They dont do that in normal cases. The way you describe the visit it seems it went very well and would go far towards removing their suspicions.  Since it went so well it could be seen as positive.  It indicates movement in your case.  Most likely they want to have the results of their visit, good or bad, to be available at your interview.  Now that the visit has taken place, the interview can be scheduled."

Her ex immediately married another woman the day after their divorce was final.  The new wife and ex never lived together - she even had another man's baby.  But  . . .  the apartment looked like she lived there down to the tampons in the bathroom cabinet.  They passed with flying colors.  He was deported three years later for other things.

1n1mcij,nazn82c,u/JMed82,2025-08-27T18:08:30+00:00,38,"In a way, 6am is the perfect time to check a legitimate marriage if you flip the script. Arranged or fake marriages (I would think) run on a schedule. If it was a fake marriage why would the couple be together over night and at 6am.

1jlfbik,mk329p7,u/ConnectInjury983,2025-03-27T22:19:49+00:00,18,"I’m actually very new to this process and I am doing this without a lawyer (we cant afford it!!), as I have just turned 21. Does my mom need to file for I-485 as well? She lives outside the U.S, so I thought that form could be filed only if she was already in the U.S. If you could please inform me of any corrections or additional information I must know, that would be so helpful! Thank you!"
1jlfbik,mk3iszv,u/ConnectInjury983,2025-03-27T23:44:23+00:00,18,"Yes! I can give context for why I believe my case was approved so fast. My mother and father both used to live in the U.S because my father was employed there. In 2010, both parents filed for green card, so USCIS already had their I-94 numbers, biometrics, social security, and A-numbers in store. They were in the process of receiving their approval, however, my father received a job offer elsewhere and made the mistake of moving the family out of the country. This resulted in their green cards being denied. Assuming USCIS still had access to my mother’s history of her presence and the information on her previous application to the green card, we submitted the same information under the immigration section of the I-130 application, pretty much confirming that my mother was once an applicant for the green card, which lead to USCIS being able to match that information quickly and easily on their end, eliciting her swift approval. "

Also, pictures with other people in them are generally better, as they show that your family and friends know about your relationship and support it. 

Also, thinking a little bit outside the box here - if you have pets, vet records with both your names might work.  Any memberships (gym, Costco, subscription) should also work. Look into gathering travel records (trips that you took together, hotel reservations, flights, visits to each other's country)."

I'm guessing you were in the US on a tourist visa, got married, and are now applying for adjustment of status?

It's a person whose job is to view immigration cases, and they are trained to look for irregularities.

You say you have been dating since 2016, and it is your job as the applicant to furnish proof. You can't just be like, ""Trust, me, bro.""

Have family members and friends sign affidavits/letters corroborating your dating history. 

Photographs with date/time stamps help show the length of your relationship, which is what they are trying to confirm.

You can use photographs and messages between the two of you that are dated to show the age of the relationship."

My timeline was very similar, but we were only together before about 2 years before marrying/filing. We were long distance this whole time, so I downloaded and printed out flights to the same destinations at the same time, additionally to the pictures.  
We didn't get any pushback during the interview at all, so maybe add any proof of traveling + vacationing together before your next interview?"

Pictures and texts are secondary evidence and people overly focus on those things. But a joint checking, joint check(voided), car insurance, renters insurance (cheap to add), health insurance etc, Are considered primary proof of marriage.

Also if your marriage is less than two years expect additional scrutiny - since it would generally grant you a conditional greencard if approved."

This what probably prompted the officer to dig in to your marriage and ask for more proof.

The rest was just photos. Photos of us visiting her family,  photos of my family visiting us,  holidays, wedding photos with family, etc with another paper describing what was going on in each photo. We submitted about 30 photos I believe.

Do you have any shared flights, can submit that.
How many photos did you submit?
Do you celebrate holidays with her family? Make sure you include those photos. If it's pics with just you two then it looks like you are not really in each other's lives...

Text/whatsapp communications dating back to 2016

Joint purchases such as flights or hotel rooms where you are both named on the receipt/email confirmation - travel itinerary showing you both together.

1ispf20,mdmj60c,u/letmeleave_damnit,2025-02-19T15:17:11+00:00,2,"The reason is because of entering the US on a non-immigrant visa.   

When was your visa application in 2016?  

They really do not like people marrying and trying to adjust status and applying for a green card when entering on anything but an immigrant visa.  

If you applied for a non immigrant visa with the intention to marry and naturalize they will claim fraud etc.  

This is what he’s trying to prove i would seek counsel of an immigration attorney"
1ispf20,mdn95e0,,2025-02-19T17:16:54+00:00,2,"Your marriage is real.

Remember when certain countries refused to recognize a same-sex marriage (entirely valid here, but not there)?

Evidence standards are what they are. I recall co-petitioning for someone, in a year when I made negative income (on tax form). Yes, you can show assets, said the lawyer, instead. But be warned, there NEVER accept proof of assets - even if you are millionaire. (So we found a different co-petitioner who had a simpler tax filing…)

Stoping thinking the US is exceptional. It’s just one country…with a particular style of selling itself"

You need affidavits from family and friends- please do as many as you can, download the history of all your text messages, plane tickets, hotel reservations. Do you live together? Have a family member send you an official mail that requires a signature to the address you live with him. Do you have any savings? Make sure theres a lot of $ on that account, make him your beneficiary for everything and vice versa.  Do you have any wedding pictures that show your engagement ring? Add a picture of that and a receipt, certificates of authenticity, invoice which shows how much it cost (hoping he spent quite a bit of money on your ring) - this will show the officer your spouse is willing to spend lot of money for you. Next.. hmm.. your lease, health insurance, have him call the city and ask them if they can put your name of the water/electricity bill if they ask why tell them you need a document you live with your spouse and they might be able to craft some document for you, get on his phone bill - call the service company and ask them to craft our some document that shows your name next to his + same address. Always try to get your name + his name + your address. Get a costco/sams club membership, do a membership for 2 people. Get a gym membership together. If i think of more ill add it but you can get this knocked out until friday."

- joint account: bank statements, lease agreements (car/apartment)
- affidavits: Make sure they are very specific about events that you all were a part of, and not generic I.e examples that you can have photos (I had 3 affidavits: family, friend, and professor)
- relationship photos: 600+ (including photos posted by others I.e graduating class, social media, dating photos, travel, if you’ve adopted a pet, family gathering. Make sure it’s a good mix of phots of yourselves and group settings. Make sure you have some photos that you can point to as specific evidence for my next point below)
- relationship statement: have a very detailed relationship statement, with specific examples that you can include photos of. Talk about things that’s very memorable to you both I.e a specific restaurant you went on a date, where you go annually to celebrate. Talk even about struggles you faced together I.e long distance because of Covid etc.

You can get the actual metadata of the photographs and submit those, I would also include any joint tax returns that you have with your spouse, any mail received for you and him both sharing the same address (it can be separate mailings meaning it doesn’t have to name both of you in the letter. So you would need to provide mail that you get at your house and mail your spouse gets and that will (should) show that you live together and I would provide multiple different documents. ) Utilities bills for the house, any mortgage payments, rent invoices/payments, lease agreement. ) those are some of the additional documents I would recommend providing with your updated medical records.

We married within 3 months and filed a couple months after the wedding (not sure how much time passed).  Maybe we applied soon after—not sure.  But we also have a 25 year age difference and our interview was easy and smooth.  Are there any other unusual details about your relationship? The documents we showed were of our living situation now that we were married—joint bank accounts as married people, health insurance together, living in the same home, we both have a job with the same home address, etc."

- emails…I forward something from Ticketmaster with a “hey just got us tickets to X”.  Anything of the sort that demonstrates things you do on a relationship 
- social media posts of you together, or a photo in someone else’s social media posts

You can try compiling a small pdf with the timeline of your relationship. If you buy each other gifts, the receipt in the email is a good proof. A lot of people says chat record but i think it is invasion of personal space. You dont want an agent to read through your sext right? Although i knew someone who had to prove her internet relationship to an embassy and she literally printed thousand of pages of their correspondence (yes even the spicy stuff).

I basically uploaded 'weak evidence ' inc photos, plane tickets, even older tax returns, mail to the same address you lived etc. I also didn't have shared bank accounts - we still dont.  it got approved after these uploads, but I do feel your frustration. There's absolutely nothing about our marriage which is not truthful and was quite hurtful, but they're doing their job and making sure that everything is in order. I'm sure everything will be ok.

2. If you traveled together 2016-2022 - flight ticket reservations for the both of you traveling together. Other receipts are good to add such as hotel, car rental, but they rarely list both of you.

Among the weak photo evidence, the best will be photos of you two with the family (parents, siblings) of both.

Did an attorney file this for you or did you hire one just to attend her interview?

If an attorney hired this for you, that attorney failed you and should file a complaint to their bar for this. Any immigration attorney could have told you that your mother was perm barred.

You should consider requesting deferred action for your mother. You are in the military and USCIS does allow servicemen and veterans to request deferred action for their children, spouse, and parents. 

While this will not give your mom permanent status, it should protect her from removal and enable her to obtain a work permit."

She has to remain outside the U.S. for 10 years then file an I-212 and then consular process. Military parole in place doesn’t work for people with the 212a9c bar.

They said if she doesn’t do so within 33 days they will began the process to get her deported and she will never be eligible to return to the US. EVER.

I think the best thing to do in this situation is for her to self deport to continue the legal process to return. Otherwise she will never be able to return if they deport her.

While out of the country you can help her file the I-129B to reoepen the case, because this decision can in no way shape of form be appealed. It’s the only best thing to do. It’s gonna take some though. But it’s better than living in fear.

Go from there, her leaving the country, and keep fighting the case. They mostly denied the case because they knew she lied on her entries and exits, not necessarily the illegal status. 
Make it as easy as possible and let her leave the country within the 33 days so she has chances to come back.

This should have been caught by DHS the first time your mom left the country after overstaying for 3 years.

If this can happen to someone's (I assume a citizen by birth, because they are deployed) mom, imagine how many actual criminals (not saying OPs mom is a criminal) are here illegally (overstaying tourist visas) without anyone knowing, until they appear at DHS or USCIS when they try to adjust their status legally, if they do. And those aren't the people being targeted by ICE raids either. It's the cases like OPs mom who is being arrested and deported by ICE, not the actual criminals.

That being said, people with no criminal records should still be punished for overstaying a visa, but a permanent ban seems excessive, especially if they have citizen family members."

I would seriously consider filing a complaint with the BAR in whichever state you filed in against this attorney. 

assuming the facts presented in the denial letter were already known or discoverable prior to filing, it would be professionally negligent—and possibly unethical—for a competent immigration attorney to proceed with a Form I-485 adjustment of status application under these circumstances.

1.	INA §212(a)(9)(C)(i) Bar:
	•	The applicant accrued over 1 year of unlawful presence and re-entered without inspection.
	•	This triggers a permanent bar unless the applicant remains outside the U.S. for 10 years and obtains advance consent to reenter/reapply (Form I-212).
	•	This bar cannot be waived from inside the U.S. and makes the applicant categorically ineligible for AOS (Adjustment of Status).
2.	No Eligibility for §245(i) or Other Exceptions:
	•	Matter of Torres-Garcia makes it very clear that this bar applies even to those with old petitions who might otherwise have qualified under 245(i).
	•	There is no grandfathering or workaround without 10 years of absence and prior consent.
3.	Multiple Uninspected Entries:
	•	Counsel should have immediately flagged that the applicant’s last entry was without inspection.
	•	Adjustment under §245(a) requires inspection and admission or parole, or a waiver (which doesn’t exist here).


What Will Not Work
	•	Remaining in the U.S. and reapplying for AOS
	•	Attempting to get a waiver while inside the U.S.
	•	Relying on claims of hardship, age, or family ties. none overcome the permanent bar under §212(a)(9)(C)(i) without the statutory 10-year absence + I-212.

You could attempt to hire a better lawyer but any realistic path forward for your mother to remain in the US is essentially nonexistent."

https://justiceactioncenter.org/news/judge-temporarily-halts-trump-administrations-attempt-to-revoke-legal-status-of-hundreds-of-thousands-grants-class-certification/

This is what I was told by JAC this week: “We are writing to let you know that Judge Talwani in our case recently stayed (temporarily blocked) the premature revocation of parole for beneficiaries who currently have parole under the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (“CHNV”) parole processes. The judge also certified a class of all individuals with CHNV parole who are still in the U.S. and subject to that revocation.

We have not received a decision from the judge with regards to the other parole processes encompassed in our lawsuit (Central American Minors Parole, Uniting for Ukraine, Operation Allies Welcome, Family Reunification Parole, and Military Parole in Place), or the pause in adjudication of immigration benefits applications submitted by parolees. We will send an update  if we receive a decision on other pending requests for relief or if there are further key developments in the litigation.  “"

And Daca is also an executive order to not enforce the law because of meh emotions. None of these save for TPS were created by congress. If anything TPS is more valid but even that is temporary and yet you have people chilling here for decades. 

I wish people understood there is a legal process no matter how slow it is."

My wife and I sent in our 485/765 on February 13th and USCIS received it on Feb 18th. They went ahead and scheduled a biometrics appointment for the 14th of March. Keep in mind, this was already past the date when the trump admin had already announced the pause. Considering the case was still moving along, it may indicate that since we applied before it could potentially still be in an active state. Hope this helps!"

I have a very similar situation and just got my US citizenship last month at a big ceremony in Oakland with 700 other people and their guests. Definitely a weird time to become a Canadian/US dual citizen but actually gives you more flexibility to spend more of your time in Canada if you want. Also current politics won't last forever. Most Americans are confused by and not in favor of what Trump is doing with Canada.

To prevent this in the future (it will happen every time until you do this…) there is a yellow paper the officers in secondary will give you. All you have to do is send an email to that address and ask to be taken off the secondary list. The process takes less than 30 days and you only need to send one email. I have not been send to secondary in years because of the email saying this happened years ago. They will not write you back but 9 times out of 10 it will get you off that list. If it helps it’s a little yellow slip that has the info on it. Google it and find the email and you will have smooth sailing going forward. I hope this helps you and others. If I find the link I’ll edit this and add it. I believe it is the redress inquiry program. Dhs.gov/dhs-trip. If I find the paper or email I send I will add it

1jt2hjy,mlwfv9u,u/Key_Situation643,2025-04-07T18:03:21+00:00,6,"The USCIS website stated this: 

If the accused is directed to attend a pre-trial diversion or intervention program, where no admission or finding of guilt is required, the order may not count as a conviction for immigration purposes.

My husband had a diversion, but I just got the paperwork today and it does not specifically say ""pretrial"", so I don't know if it counts the same as ""pretrial diversion"" as I think all states word it  slightly differently. It was also dismissed after diversion completed but it says ""with prejudice"", not without. Meaning that he wouldn't be considered a first time offender anymore. He has no charge since then. Originally he pled not guilty but it is a CIMT charge. I think the trick is, the prosecutors don't tell the defendant that this has an effect on immigration status, they just want to get it over quickly so that's why he took diversion. He's disclosing it, and it was 23 years ago. It also qualifies as a petty offense because the underlying sentence if convicted was something like 48 hours in jail and/or $500 fine. His arrest record was ""expunged"", we did that because it was cheap enough to do, but he's still absolutely disclosing it. 

I think that is the best scenario is to disclose it as you did."

>(3) Issuance of a Notice To Appear (NTA) .

>Upon completion of adjudication of a visa petition filed on behalf of an alien who is illegally in the United States, the adjudicating officer must consider whether USCIS or DHS should initiate removal proceedings through the issuance of a Notice to Appear. Generally, NTAs should be issued if the beneficiary is illegally in the United States and is not immediately eligible to apply for adjustment of status (e.g., if he or she is subject to bars to adjustment contained in sections 245(a) or 245(c) of the Act ).

>Only certain officials have the regulatory authority to issue NTAs (see 8 CFR 239.1 ) and the director of each office or center determines which unit within that office or center exercises that authority. For example, in some offices, upon completion of adjudicative action, cases are referred from the Adjudications Branch to the Investigations Branch for consideration of NTA issuance; in other offices the NTA is prepared by the Adjudications Branch and signed by the ADD for Examinations or ADD for Adjudications. Follow the procedures set forth in your local office or center.

I found the same section in a page of the AFM [from 2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20051224233241/http://uscis.gov:80/lpbin/lpext.dll/inserts/afm_redacted/afm-95-redacted-3578?f=templates&fn=document-frame.htm), so it doesn't seem to be new."

I filed my i485 in Dec last yr. This yr I switched from H1B status to EAD in Feb. In March my H1B status was revoked as expected. In July, I got NTA, stating that I overstayed my VISA despite my authorized stay from i485 filing. Right now my lawyer is filing for motion to terminate the proceeding. It's a big mess."
1mjkol6,n7ctjag,u/Happy_camper9754,2025-08-07T03:34:37+00:00,4,Don't freak out yet. I really want to see how these policies are going to be applied in real life. I’m wondering if this language points out that you could be removed if your application gets denied and you had an overstay or if they will deny your AOS just because you overstayed. It's not very clear to me.

1mjkol6,n7bsw8u,u/DirectGift1019,2025-08-06T23:55:29+00:00,7,"I see you a mention that concurrent filing of i485 and i131 does not fall into the category for NTA. Why?

Since concurrent filing is used for AOS some people go out of status while AOS is pending. What does this mean for someone like me who is on STEM OPT set to expire a year after I file my AOS (concurrent filing of I-131 and I-485)?

I legally entered and have been maintaining my f1 status. I would be out of status when my stem
Opt ends during my AOS application being pending. Can’t leave US because that would mean abandoning my AOS."

In some areas its taking much longer to adjudicate a greencard than 90 days allowed for K1, and Id imagine many students get married when they complete their degree so may be out of status shortly after filing. "

It is up to the officer to determine if an NTA will be issued. If you have a dual intent visa, keep it current. If not, make sure your adjustment package is well prepared to avoid as many issues if possible. And, if it’s a marriage-based filing, just be prepared to be split. May not happen but prepare for it."

Obama counted the turn backs at the border as deportations when previous administrations had never counted them as deportations.  Obama falsely embellished his numbers and multiple of those turn back (voluntary returns) were third and forth time catch and release cases.   He was counting the same people over and over until the eventually became got aways.  Holder was not prosecuting repeat illegal entry cases.  So Obama did two things lied to look tough on immigration but also gave a great number of what the left deems as a very acceptable number that we should continue to strive to deport.  Obama let hordes of illegals who were contacted by ERO in the jails in the interior remain in the US and gave them quasi legal work authority.  It was a complete farse.  I caught a Honduran for a misdemeanor driving crime and delivered him to the jail.  The same Honduran had been caught the week earlier by a county street crimes team delivering a substantial amount of cocaine to other Honduran dealers.  This guy was the go between and not the street level dealer.   Obama had shut down the local ERO office and I spoke to someone in New Hampshire - all the way across the US.  Despite explaining the arrest history they said ‘sorry under the new EO we can only issue a detainer if he’s convicted of the felony not just arrested for it’.   That’s exactly what Obama did as a leftist, he promoted criminal aliens as more important than public safety.  Absolutely the worst president for law and order.

It will raise a red flag but it should still be possible to re-enter with proof of ties to the US. More than a year though and the green card will be considered abandoned unless they apply for a reentry permit.

I spoke with plenty of agents when our efforts to arrest and remove the uninvited.  You’re just wishing the garbage policy the Obama administration practiced was false and choosing to be intellectually dishonest.  Obama massively eliminated interior enforcement.  His entire regime of his second term was an attempt to give status to millions of illegals in order to get the Hispanic vote - completely deaf to the fact Hispanic Americans despise illegals jumping the line when many of them had to follow legitimate pathways.  Obama was an abomination to immigration enforcement, spend a monte actually fact checking his manipulation of numbers or maybe MSNBC and CNN have convinced you to ignore reality.  And yes he was HATED by most feds for his smug attitude and his encouragement for a war on the police."

7 out of 10 asylum applications have no claim and simply made up just to get into the US and stay here. You can have the word “vast” and I can simply use “absolute majority” then. 

Honestly if the numbers are so high to begin with there’s a big problem and I believe numbers should be even higher. Because they hurt people actually being persecuted in their home countries."
1nbvfzg,nd9nctw,u/Dramatic_Taste_61,2025-09-09T14:11:41+00:00,2,"Words mean things. ""The vast majority"" means an overwhelmingly large portion or percentage of a group. Typically this is 80 to just under 100% of the group. Only 24% of asslyum cases have been approved nationan wide historically (76% denied) one would call that a vast majority within the margin of error. The point is there is a substantial probability your asylum case will be denied. Im not saying right or wrong just stating what is."

I’m sorry you didn’t get to enjoy your oath ceremony so much. My wife and I loved our (separate) ones. Perhaps it had a little to do with the fact that both were led by female USCIS officers, who gave very different, but still extremely heartfelt, moving, and all around beautiful speeches.

My oath ceremony was fairly low-key, and it was a humbling experience for me, but I do recall feeling the immediate post-oath moment was a bit anticlimactic as well. Like... wait, that's it? The journey is over? 😁

Wasn't til I was at the passport appointment later that afternoon that the excited feeling returned. 

We had a very experienced federal judge lead our oath, and even the judge read it from a sheet. I'm sure there are people out there that can recite it, but considering how important the words are legally, I kinda sorta see why an official might want to read it every time they administer it."

That started a 10 year journey to citizenship.

UK to USA.
Met in 2008.
Started dating in 2014.
Married in 2015, planned to live in the US.
Refused entrance September 2016.
Entered on a IR-1 in May 2019.
Applied for citizenship February 2025.
Interview was August 2025.
Ceremony September 2025.

Aside from the refused entrance in 2016, I had nothing to be concerned about.

Total journey time - 10 years.
Total journey cost - $26000."
